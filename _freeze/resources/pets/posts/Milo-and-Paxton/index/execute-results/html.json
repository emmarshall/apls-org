He just loved it so much he had to stay (for 7 more years). Milo is an exceptionally well-traveled dog - having driven from coast to coast at least twice and spent two weeks living with a truck driver. He loves a good road trip. We adopted Paxton in November 2020 and he is living easy.\nquote: |\n  Milo: \"Just throw, don't take\"\nimage: featured.jpg\ncategories: \n  - Pit-Boxer mix\n  - Cat\ntalent: |\n  Milo is amazing at fetch and can catch anything on one bound. Paxton is very fast and climbs his condo with grace.\nhabit: |\n  Milo can get a little excited to see people and then puts all his weight on them to make them stay because he loves them so much. Paxton attacks ankles.\ntitle-block-categories: false\ntitle-block-banner: false\ntitle-block-style: none\n---\n\n\n::: grid\n::: {#about-pet-text .g-col-12 .g-col-md-6}\n![](featured.jpg){.lightbox}\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-6}\n::: {simple-info}\n# Meet {{< meta title >}}\n\n### Quote: \n\n> {{< meta quote >}}\n\n### Breed:\n\n\n{{< meta categories >}}\n\n\n\n### Bad Habit:\n\n\n{{< meta habit >}}\n\n\n\n### Special Talent:\n\n\n{{< meta talent >}}\n\n\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n##### Submitted by: {{< meta human >}}\n\n## Bio\n\n\n{{< meta description >}}\n\n\n\n## Gallery\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/pet gallery-1.png){width=1200}\n:::\n:::",
