Berryessa, Assistant Professor, School of Criminal Justice, Rutgers University\ndescription: |\n  Sam is a sweet, fun-loving girl who was found on the streets of Philly as a kitten when I was in grad school! I adopted her when she was eight weeks old and she has come with me on my moves and adventures over the last six years.
