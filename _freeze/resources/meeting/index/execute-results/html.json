That can change if you want it to.\n:::\n\nThe content for the site is stored in the shared AP-LS Google Drive and the pages for the site are all stored on [GitHub](https://github.com).\n\n### Making things easier\n\n-   With git and version control we can spend less time maintaining a better record of what charges are made and when (and by whom).\n\n-   By storing the content for our site in the shared `googledrive` we can streamline the process of making annual updates and also present more dynamic content on our pages.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset .box-shadow}\n\n## Example 1: Executive Committee\n\n![Contact information for the 2022-2023 Executive Officers and Committee pages is now stored in a spreadsheet](images/leadership.png){fig-alt=\"Image of a spreadsheet will contact information\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"472\"}\n\nTo update the new directory page for next year, you just have to create a duplicate spreadsheet and provide the updated url to the code block within the `leadership.qmd` or `committees.qmd` file.\n\nThe information will be read into `r` and formatted for publication on the site:\n\n![](images/listing.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n#### For additional information about how this workflow can be used to make interactive tables: see [Committees](../../about/committees.html) or [Conference schedule](../../conferences/schedule.html)\n\n\n## Example 2: Pets!\n\nWe can also use a similar process to collect and share content solicited from our membership.\n\nTake a look at the newly renovated [Pets of AP-LS](../pets/index.html) blog post page. This is a project of the Student Committee and is now set up to generate a new post whenever someone submits a new pet via the associated google form.\n\nWhen we receive a new pet, the data will be read into `r` and generate a new `index.qmd` template file with those details.\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Here is the form](images/form.png){width=739}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![... here is the yaml header that is automatically generated](images/yml.png){width=1293}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOnce we confirm and approve that the submission is legitimate, we can render the doc and add it to our site.\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![... and here is a very cute pup](images/fitz.png){width=1015}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### For a less adorable example of a listing page: see [Grants & Awards](../../awards/index.html)\n\n:::\n",
