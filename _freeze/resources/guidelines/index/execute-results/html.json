Application of the Guidelines does not depend on the practitioner’s typical areas of practice or expertise, but rather on the service provided in the case at hand. These Guidelines apply in all matters in which psychologists provide expertise to judicial, administrative, and educational systems including, but not limited to, examining or treating persons in anticipation of or subsequent to legal, contractual, administrative, proceedings; offering expert opinion about psychological issues in the form of amicus briefs or testimony to judicial, legislative or administrative bodies; acting in an adjudicative capacity; serving as a trial consultant or otherwise offering expertise to attorneys, the courts, or others; conducting research in connection with, or in the anticipation of, litigation; or involvement in educational activities of a forensic nature.\n\n## Definitions & Terminology\n\n\nFor the purposes of these Guidelines:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"reactable html-widget html-fill-item-overflow-hidden html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-7a7615d904bf5b375398\" style=\"width:auto;height:auto;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-7a7615d904bf5b375398\">{\"x\":{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"Reactable\",\"attribs\":{\"data\":{\"term\":[\"Appropriate\",\"Agreement\",\"Assent\",\"Consent\",\"Client\",\"Conflict of Interest\",\"Decisionmaker\",\"Examinee\",\"Forensic Examiner\",\"Forensic Practice\",\"Forensic Practitioner\",\"Forensic Psychology\",\"Informed Consent\",\"Legal Representative\",\"Party\",\"Reasonable or Reasonably\",\"Record or Written Record\",\"Retaining Party\",\"Tribunal\",\"Trier of Fact\"],\"define\":[\"Appropriate when used in relation to conduct by a forensic practitioner means that, according to the prevailing professional judgment of competent forensic practitioners, the conduct is apt and pertinent and is considered befitting, suitable and proper for a particular person, place, condition, or function.

The current  revision, now called the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology (referred to as Guidelines throughout this document), replace the 1991 Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists. \n\n#### Revision Process \nThis revision of the Guidelines was coordinated by the Committee for the Revision of the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology, which was established by the American Academy of Forensic Psychology and the American Psychology-Law Society (Division 41 of the American Psychological Association) in 2002 and operated through 2011.  This Committee consisted of two representatives from each organization (Solomon Fulero, PhD, JD, Stephen Golding, PhD, ABPP, Lisa Piechowski, PhD, ABPP, Christina Studebaker, PhD) a Chairperson (Randy Otto, PhD, ABPP), and a liaison from APA Division 42 (Jeffrey Younggren, PhD, ABPP). \n\nThis document was revised in accordance with American Psychological Association Rule 30.08 and the APA policy document Criteria for the development and evaluation of practice guidelines (APA, 2001).  The Committee posted announcements regarding the revision process to relevant electronic discussion lists and professional publications (i.e., Psylaw-L email listserve, American Academy of Forensic Psychology listserve, American Psychology-Law Society Newsletter).  \n\nIn addition, an electronic discussion list devoted solely to issues concerning revision of the Guidelines was operated between December 2002 and July 2007, followed by establishment of an e-mail address in February 2008 (sgfp@yahoo.com).  Individuals were invited to provide input and commentary on the existing Guidelines and proposed revisions via these means. In addition, two public meetings were held throughout the revision process at biennial meetings of the American Psychology-Law Society.\n\nUpon development of a draft that the Revisions Committee deemed suitable, the revised Guidelines were submitted for review to the Executive Committee of the American Psychology-Law Society and Division 41 of the American Psychological Association, and to the American Board of Forensic Psychology.  \n\nOnce the revised Guidelines were approved by these two organizations, they were submitted to the American Psychological Association for review, commentary, and acceptance, consistent with the American Psychological Association’s Criteria for Practice Guideline Development and Evaluation (Committee on Professional Practice and Standards, 2001) and Rule 30-8.  They were subsequently revised by the Revisions Committee and  were adopted by the American Psychological Association Council of Representatives on [insert date here].\n\n#### Developers and Support\nThe Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology were developed by the American Psychology-Law Society (Division 41 of the American Psychological Association) and the American Academy of Forensic Psychology.\n\n#### Current Status\nThese Guidelines are scheduled to expire [insert date here].  After this date, users are encouraged to contact the American Psychological Association Practice Directorate to confirm that this document remains in effect.\n\n\nSGFP Guidelines originally adopted in 1991 (PDF, 64KB)\n\n{{< downloadthis files/1991-draft.pdf dname:\"PDF, 64KB\" >}}\n\n\n\nJanuary 2006 Draft of the Revised SGFP Guidelines (PDF, 87KB)\n\n{{< downloadthis files/2006-draft.pdf dname:\"PDF, 64KB\" >}}\n\n\n\nFebruary 2008 Draft of the Revised SGFP Guidelines (PDF, 99KB)\n\n{{< downloadthis files/2008-feb-draft.pdf >}}\n\n\n\nSeptember 2008 Draft of the Revised SGFP Guidelines (PDF, 91KB)\n\n{{< downloadthis files/2008-feb-draft.pdf >}}\n\n\n\nAugust 2010 Draft of the Revised SGFP Guidelines (PDF, 169KB)\n\n{{< downloadthis files/2010-draft.pdf >}}\n\n\n\n:::",
