We strongly encourage empirically based proposals, proposals that involve new and emerging topics within psychology and law, and proposals that incorporate historically marginalized or underrepresented populations. Proposals will be evaluated through a blind review process focused on intellectual merit, innovation, novelty, and integration of multiple aspects of the field.\n\n**Special Consideration for Artificial Intelligence (AI) Submissions**\n\nSpecial consideration will be given to proposals regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in psychology and law. AI is defined as technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, decision making, creativity, and autonomy. We are particularly interested in empirical studies addressing machine models, deep learning models, and large learning models (LLMs).\n:::\n\n<center>\n\nAll proposals must be submitted on the conference website by <br> [Wednesday, October 15, 2025, 11:59 pm PST]{.session-time}\n\nVisit the Ex Ordo portal to register, submit your proposals, AND sign up as a reviewer!\n\n[{{< fa user-plus aria-hidden=\"true\" >}} Register here](https://ap-ls2026.exordo.com/login){.btn .btn-outline-primary role=\"button\"}\n\n</center>\n\n> If you have any questions or comments about the conference, please contact the conference co-chairs at [conference\\@ap-ls.org](mailto:conference@ap-ls.org) </br></br> *2026 AP-LS Conference Co-Chairs* <br> Heath Hodges & Luna Filipović\n\n## Proposal Types & Submission Requirements\n\n[Proposal Types & Submission Requirements]{.plenary}\n\n::: callout-note\nSubmission requirements have been modified to be more convenient. Specifically, the 1,000-word summary requirement has been omitted for all submissions, except Symposia. In lieu of this, the word count for abstracts is a slightly larger (i.e., 400-500 words).\n:::\n\n::: vspace\n:::\n\n[Symposia]{.plenary}\n\n::: session-description\n**Symposia:** A 60-to-80-minute session with multiple presentations (i.e., papers) focused on a single topic. This includes an independent discussant/chair and a minimum of 3 papers and no more than 5 papers. \n:::\n\n[Papers]{.plenary}\n\n::: session-description\n**Papers:** A paper is a presentation describing an individual research topic or piece of legal scholarship. Accepted papers are clustered into 60-minute sessions, with 3-4 papers in each session. Whenever possible, papers are organized into themed sessions. \n:::\n\n[Data-blitz]{.plenary}\n\n::: session-description\n**Data-blitz:** A data-blitz is face-paced, 5-minute presentation (limited to 3 PowerPoint slides) covering a bite-sized piece of emerging psycho-legal research. Accepted proposals are clustered into 60-minute sessions, with approximately 10 data-blitz es in each session. Whenever possible, data-blitzes are loosely organized by topic.<br>\n:::\n\n[Posters]{.plenary}\n\n::: session-description\n**Posters:** A poster is a concise, visual summary of research or legal scholarship that is displayed on a large poster board (e.g., 4’ x 6’). Accepted posters are presented during one of two evening poster sessions, typically Friday and Saturday evening, during the conference. They are not organized by topic. While not required, we encourage presenters to adhere to the [APA Convention Poster Instructions](https://convention.apa.org/presenters/posters), including the use of the [Better Poster format](https://convention.apa.org/blog/rethinking-the-science-poster).\n\n:::\n\n::: vspace\n:::\n\n## Call for Reviewers\n\n[Call for Reviewers]{.plenary}\n\n::: session-description\n**Posters:**  Reviewers, including professional and graduate student reviewers, are invited for all content areas. Proposals will be distributed for review in late October. Reviews will be due in late November, prior to Thanksgiving.\n:::\n\n::::::\n\n::: vspace\n:::\n\n\n\n::: vspace\n:::\n\n:::: simple-info\n# Hotel Information {#hotel}\n\n::: {.panel-tabset .box-shadow}\n## {{< fa hotel aria-hidden=\"true\" >}} Peppermill Resort Spa Casino\n\n![](https://images.bestwestern.com/bwi/brochures/29095/photos/1024/25995732.jpg){fig-align=\"center\" fig-alt=\"Exterior view of the Peppermill Resort Spa Casino\"}\n\n<center>[{{< fa map aria-hidden=\"true\" >}} Plan your trip](https://www.worldhotels.com/content/luxury-hotels/en_US/book/hotels-in-reno/peppermill-resort-spa-casino/propertyCode.29095.html){.btn .btn-outline-primary role=\"button\"} [{{< fa location-dot aria-hidden=\"true\" >}} Map](){.btn .btn-outline-primary role=\"button\"}</center>\n\n::: vspace2\n:::\n\nThe 2025 AP-LS Conference will be held at the [Peppermill Resort Spa Casino](https://www.worldhotels.com/content/luxury-hotels/en_US/book/hotels-in-reno/peppermill-resort-spa-casino/propertyCode.29095.html)\n:::\n::::\n",
