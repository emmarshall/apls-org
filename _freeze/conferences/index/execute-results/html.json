We strongly encourage empirically based proposals, proposals that involve new and emerging topics within psychology and law, and proposals that incorporate historically marginalized or underrepresented populations. Proposals will be evaluated through a blind review process focused on intellectual merit, innovation, novelty, and integration of multiple aspects of the field.\n\n**Special Consideration for Artificial Intelligence (AI) Submissions**\n\nSpecial consideration will be given to proposals regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in psychology and law. AI is defined as technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, decision making, creativity, and autonomy. We are particularly interested in empirical studies addressing machine models, deep learning models, and large learning models (LLMs).\n:::\n\n<center>\n\nAll proposals must be submitted on the conference website by <br> [Wednesday, October 15, 2025, 11:59 pm PST]{.session-time}\n\n[Visit the Ex Ordo portal here](https://ap-ls2026.exordo.com/login) to register, submit your proposals, AND sign up as a reviewer!\n\n\n</center>\n\n\n[Proposal Types & Submission Requirements]{.plenary}\n\n::: vspace\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\nSubmission requirements have been modified to be more convenient.

These workshops are scheduled to take place the day before the general conference programming begins: on Wednesday, March 11, 2026. We are seeking workshop proposals for innovative and cutting-edge topics and ask presenters to briefly describe how their proposed workshop promotes equity, inclusion, and justice in psychology and law.\n\nWe are particularly eager to receive proposals on the topics listed below. However, we encourage submissions on any aspect of psychology and law. Even if your proposal idea doesn't align with these specific topics, we still invite you to submit a proposal!\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Innovative and cutting edge topics\n\n{{< fa circle-right aria-hidden=\"true\" >}} Telepractice (at an intermediate level) </br> {{< fa circle-right aria-hidden=\"true\" >}} Working in large institutional settings <br> {{< fa circle-right aria-hidden=\"true\" >}} Grants (e.g., applying for and receiving) <br> {{< fa circle-right aria-hidden=\"true\" >}} Statistics (e.g., in reference to peer-reviewing and examining qualitative data) <br> {{< fa circle-right aria-hidden=\"true\" >}} Al and forensic psychology <br> {{< fa circle-right aria-hidden=\"true\" >}} Career training for early-career scholars and clinicians <br> {{< fa circle-right aria-hidden=\"true\" >}} Career training for mid-career scholars and clinicians <br> {{< fa circle-right aria-hidden=\"true\" >}} Working with aging forensic populations (e.g., individuals with dementia)\n:::\n\nWorkshop presenters will receive an honorarium commensurate with the workshop length (1.e., half-day or full-day). **Proposals are due by 11:59 PM PDT, October 15, 2025,** and can be submitted [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScCMpSZYxr6JKElDfZIGK8DQHUJ3bgt0CYmfRm5mcmVxrsBYQ/viewform?usp=send_form). Contact Sara Millspaugh, Ph.D., at `ce@ap-ls.org` with any questions.\n\n**Please note:** The pre-conference workshops are separate from general AP-LS conference programming (e.g., separate application portals and review processes). Therefore, you are welcome to submit proposals to both the CE Committee for a preconference workshop and to the AP-LS Conference Chairs for general conference programming from March 12th to 14th, 2026.\n\nWe look forward to receiving your pre-conference workshop proposals!\n\nSara Millspaugh, Ph.D. <br> Pronouns: she/her <br> Chair, AP-LS CE Committee\n:::::\n:::::::\n",
