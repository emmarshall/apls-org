Forensic evaluators are often ill-equipped to handle the special considerations that ID presents, especially during competency evaluations. This workshop will aim to give attendees a better understanding of ID and how it impacts interactions with the criminal justice system, with a particular focus on competency evaluations. First, we will discuss the definitions of ID, how to assess for and diagnose ID, and other diagnostic considerations (e.g., masking and subtle representations of ID). Second, we plan to discuss the role ID has had on court decisions and the criminal justice system in the past. Here, we will discuss landmark Supreme Court cases and special considerations of criminal defendants with ID. Finally, we will focus on competency evaluations and special considerations for these evaluations when working with clients with suspected or known ID. In this section, we will discuss how ID can impact one’s competency abilities and how to assess for these issues. During this portion, we will also discuss how to identify ID as a clinical concern for competency, educating attorneys about ID, and forensic competency measures, with a focus on providing an overview of an updated version of the CAST-MR (CAST-ID), a measure designed to assess competency for individuals with ID. This presentation will be created in collaboration with Caroline Everington, the creator of the CAST-MR, and Jim Ellis, a leading legal expert on ID and the U.S. legal system.\",{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"className\":\"detail-label\"},\"children\":[\"Learning Objectives\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"className\":\"objectives\"},\"children\":[{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{},\"children\":[\"1.

The field is in much better shape than in the past; however, significant problems of quality remain, with much room for improvement. We provide an overview of forensic psychology’s history and discuss its possible future, with multiple audiences in mind. We distill decades of scholarship from and about fundamental basic science and forensic science, clinical and forensic psychology, and the law of expert evidence into eight best practices for the validity of a forensic psychological assessment. We argue these best practices should apply when a psychological assessment relies on the norms, values, and esteem of science to inform legal processes. The eight key considerations include (a) foundational validity of the assessment; (b) validity of the assessment as applied; (c) management and mitigation of bias; (d) attention to quality assurance; (e) appropriate communication of data, results, and opinions; (f) explicit consideration of limitations and assumptions; (g) weighing of alternative views or disagreements; and (h) adherence with ethical obligations, professional guidelines, codes of conduct, and rules of evidence.

We believed, naively at the time, that bringing science to bear on the question of risk of “dangerousness” would be salutary. Over the ensuing two decades Dr. Righthand and I observed to our dismay how our own work was misused, often blatantly, in juvenile court. By 2016, we set out to rectify the “problem” through the development of a new scale, an approach that we hoped would help to dial back the direction of the juvenile court to the pre-Gault era of concern for the health & welfare of its young dependents. Over a period of 3 years, Drs. Righthand, Kang and I worked with a large team to develop and beta-test in 5 states the Youth Needs Progress Scale (YNPS). The YNPS has one overarching goal: following an RNR model, laser-focusing on individualized “needs” and the remediation of those needs that were most responsible for risk of re-offense. This workshop will overview 1. The problems inherent in targeted assessment of “risk” in juveniles, the development of the YNPS, and the illustration of decreases in YNPS scores over 4 reassessments spanning 1 year of treatment, as well as decreases in YNPS scores irrespective of baseline risk assessed by the J-SOAP-II.\",{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"className\":\"detail-label\"},\"children\":[\"Learning Objectives\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"className\":\"objectives\"},\"children\":[{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{},\"children\":[\"1.

However, forensic and correctional settings present unique challenges. While general ethical standards and APA’s Guidelines for the Practice of Telepsychology (2013) provide broader aspirations, practitioners and scientists working along the spectrum of psychology-law would benefit from guidance that is more tailored to the legal context. In 2020, the AP-LS executive committee commissioned a taskforce of professionals with a diverse range of qualifications and expertise to create a comprehensive set of recommendations related to assessment, treatment, court communications, training (including teaching and supervision), and research. This collaborative effort resulted in the Recommendations for the Use of Telepsychology in Psychology-Law Practice and Research (2022). Workshop attendees will get a first-hand overview of how the Recommendations were drafted, their intended use in the field, and key considerations relative to each content area from the co-chairs of the APLS taskforce. The co-chairs/presenters will facilitate interactive discussions and walk attendees through hypothetical case scenarios to reinforce the application of recommendations in practice. Because the Recommendations are based on a nascent but expanding research base, attendees will also leave with a better understanding about how to critically evaluate, conduct, and report research in this area. As forensic mental health professionals further embrace and rely on telepsychology in their work with forensic and correctional populations, it will be important to keep up with evolving guidelines, scientific literature, and legislative changes.\",{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"className\":\"detail-label\"},\"children\":[\"Learning Objectives\"]},{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{\"className\":\"objectives\"},\"children\":[{\"name\":\"div\",\"attribs\":{},\"children\":[\"1.
