Each division establishes its own criteria for nominations â€” sometimes the same as APA criteria, but usually involving additional requisites relevant to that division.

Fellow nominations are made by a division to which the member belongs.\n\n#### The minimum standards for fellow status are:\n\n-   Doctoral degree based in part upon a psychological dissertation, or from a program primarily psychological in nature and conferred by a regionally accredited graduate or professional school.\n\n-   Prior status as an APA member for at least one year. Active engagement at the time of nomination in the advancement of psychology in any of its aspects.\n\n-   Five years of acceptable professional experience subsequent to the granting of the doctoral degree.\n\n-   Evidence of unusual and outstanding contribution or performance in the field of psychology.\n\n## Nominations\n\nMembers nominated for fellow status through AP-LS must provide evidence of unusual and outstanding contributions in the area of psychology and law.\n\n::: {.simple-info}\nDownload the full list of official criteria below.\n\n[{{< fa file-pdf >}} Div. 41 Fellowship Criteria](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A8u1YHNDpEHprrG4jJuqW7YPXIumLCAG/view?usp=sharing){.btn-action .btn .btn-primary role=\"button\"}\n\n:::\n\nðŸ“† The deadline for receipt of all application materials (nominee's materials and endorsers' materials) is **December 15.**\n\nðŸ”— For application materials and information about how to apply, please go to [APA Fellows](http://www.apa.org/members/your-membership/fellows/index.aspx).\n\nðŸ“§ For further information about the application process, please contact the [Fellows Committee chair](../../about/committees.html).\n:::\n\n",
