Projects are eligible for consideration for this award if they investigate topics related to psychology, law, diversity, and/or multiculturalism (e.g., research pertaining to psycholegal issues on race, gender, culture, sexual orientation, etc.), or if the principal investigator is a member of an underrepresented group, including racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and students with disabilities. Consistent with the mission of the BRIDGE Committee, these awards are intended to facilitate the research of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in AP-LS, as well as research about issues of potential interest and importance to such groups. \n\nEach year the BRIDGE Committee will award up to three grants in the amount of `$2,000`, with an option to divide two of the awards into two `$1,000` mini-grants.\n\n:::{.callout-caution}\n## Keep in mind\nThis award is not intended to be used to fund conference travel cost. If assistance is needed with funding travel costs to the AP-LS Conference, students should consider applying for a [Diversity Travel Award](../conference/diversitytravelaward.qmd). \n\nPlease remember that applicants can only receive funding from one BRIDGE award per year. \n:::\n\n## Eligibility\n\nApplicants must be a [Student Affiliate](../../membership/index.qmd) member of AP-LS. \n\nBoth graduate and undergraduate students are eligible, and students from underrepresented groups are strongly encouraged to apply. Underrepresented groups include but are not limited to racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBTQIA individuals, and students with physical disabilities.\n\nThe proposed research must primarily be the original work of the student applicant. In their proposal, students should describe any relationship between the proposed project and their advisers' research, as well as any other funding for the project (student or adviser). Applicants should request funding only for expenses not covered by their own or their advisers' existing funding. \n\nApplicants cannot receive more than one mini-grant from AP-LS for the same project.\n\n## How to Apply\n\nFor more information about the Diversity Program, please contact the program chair, [James Andretta](mailto:andretta@bridgetownpsychological.com).\n\n::: callout-tip\n## A complete application should contain:\n\n1.
