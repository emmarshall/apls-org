Proposed funding requests for reimbursement of past research expenses of completed projects are not eligible.\n\n-   Research projects identified in proposals are required to have ACTIVE Institutional Review Board approval from the host research institution(s) BEFORE the submission deadline. Proof of ethical (IRB) approval must be submitted along with the proposal document for an application to be deemed complete and eligible for review by the Grants-in-Aid Committee. This IRB approval MUST contain a clear approval and expiration date, and the title and project description must match the proposal project. If the project is exempt, an expiration date is not required. Any proposed research project without notification of ethical approval before the submission deadline will be considered ineligible for the award.\n\n-   The maximum for any individual award is set at $2,000. Any requests for funding beyond $2,000 will not be considered. Proposed research projects with an anticipated budget of over $2,000 should identify within the proposal the plan for covering the remaining costs to demonstrate that the research is feasible.\n\n-   Applicants who previously submitted a Grant in Aid proposal that was not selected for funding are permitted to revise and resubmit their proposal for consideration during the next funding cycle.\n\n-   Applicants who previously received Grants-in-Aid funding from the committee are eligible to apply for the award again to fund a new research project provided that the research from the previous award has been completed. Past award winners must include an abstract (200 words or fewer) in their proposal application that succinctly summarizes the previous research funded by the award. Funding may be prioritized for applicants who have not yet received the Grant in Aid in prior cycles.\n\n## How to Apply\n\nInterested individuals should submit a complete award application via the AP-LS proposal management system by 11:59 p.m. PST on the date of the identified submission deadline. \n\nAnnual application deadlines are **October 15** and **February 15**.\n\nA complete Grant in Aid application includes:\n\n-   A grant proposal (see proposal instructions and guidelines below)\n \n-   Documentation of ACTIVE IRB approval status for the proposed research project from the host research institution(s). That is, the IRB submission has to be approved by the IRB; in submission IRB applications are not sufficient. The IRB approval documentation MUST contain a clear approval and expiration date, and the title and project description must match the proposal project. \n\n\n-   Completed appropriate SIGNED tax form: W-9 tax form for U.S. citizens and W-8BEN tax form for international students. Tax forms submitted that do not include the signature will be considered incomplete applications. \n\n\n## Proposal Instructions and Guidelines\n\nApplicants are to provide a grant proposal (a maximum of 3,000 words excluding title page, abstract and references, but inclusive of all other items) that includes:\n\n1. A **title page** indicating the title of the project, name, address, phone number, and email address of the investigator. Please also include the research menotr's name and title. \n\n2. An **abstract** of 200 words or less summarizing the project\n\n3. **Project background** that reviews purpose, theoretical rationale, and significance of the project\n\n4. **Project method** that provides a detailed description of the project’s participants, design, materials, and/or procedures to be employed. The proposal is required to address open science practices. \n\n5. **Analytic plan** that describes the proposed analyses that will be used to analyze the research questions/hypotheses. \n6. **Significance** section that identifies the importance of the research and how the project furthers the field of psychology and law. \n\n7. **Budget and justification** that identifies the specific amount requested, including a detailed project budget and justification for expenses as needed\n\n8. **Timeline** that includes a detailed timeline of when the project will be completed. Please also note any plans for dissemination of the findings. \n\n10. **References**\n\nProposal documents should be formatted according to the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, Seventh Edition, and submitted in an electronic format (preferably MS Word or PDF). Please note, the IRB approval and Tax forms should be attached separately to the application and not included in the main document. \n\n\nApplicants who previously received Grants-in-Aid funding from the committee must include an additional abstract (200 words or less) in their proposal application that succinctly summarizes the previous research funded by the award.\n\nBudget items typically funded include (but are not limited to) payment of subjects, photocopying, purchase of testing materials, software not typically provided via universities and electronic media. The committee does not typically provide funds for computers (though peripherals may be funded), office supplies and furniture (e.g., file cabinets), mileage, paying research assistants and software, or equipment typically available within universities.  If a student is requesting specific software or equipment that is typically available within universities, they must provide sufficient justification for why they cannot obtain the resources from their university and the necessity of the software/equipment for the project. Conference and other travel costs are not funded.\n\nProposed research projects with an anticipated budget of over $2,000 should explain in the budget how these additional project costs intend to be covered. Projects requesting funding for payment of subjects should provide appropriate justification for both the number of participants being requested (e.g., a power analysis) and the amount of compensation being awarded for each participant. Projects requesting funding for payment of subjects from online sources (MTurk, Qualtrics panels, etc.) should provide justification for the amount of compensation being provided to subjects and account for any overhead costs charged by the site for using their services within the budget.\n\n::: callout-note\nThe use of AI tools to generate the written grant proposal will be considered plagiarism. This grant is expected to reflect your own work and thinking. If you are uncertain whether the programs you are utilizing comply with the AI policy of the grant, please contact committee chair. \n:::\n\n## Proposal Review Criteria\nThe Grants-in-Aid Committee will review and evaluate your project proposal based on the following criteria:\n\n-   **Relevancy:** The proposed research clearly addresses practice, research, and/or public policy directly relevant to the field of psychology and law.\n\n-   **Rationale:** The proposed research includes a sound, thoughtful, and logical rationale for the proposed project; the logic of the proposal and literature review is clear and strong; the proposed method flows from the rationale itself.\n\n-   **Methodology:** The proposed research provides a complete and clear description of the sample, design, and procedure to be employed that demonstrates a sound research strategy appropriate to answer the research question(s). This includes an appropriate analytic plan.\n\n-   **Significance:** The proposed research will have meaning for the field of psychology and law, or contribute significantly to theory or knowledge on such topics.\n\n-   **Open Science:** The proposed research employs practices that increase the transparency and accessibility of the science itself, such as (but not limited to): commitment to pre-registering hypotheses, making code and data easily accessible, and/or having a plan for disseminating findings.\n\n-   **Feasibility:** The proposed research can realistically be completed by students as outlined in the proposal based on the planned time, sample accessibility, materials, supports, and applicant’s research training and abilities.\n\n-   **Budget:** The requested budget items are critical to the completion of the project, clearly detailed, justified and within the scope of the identified items traditionally funded by the Grants-in-Aid Committee. If the student is paying online participants, the fees are adequately calculated and appropriate for the amount of time participants spend.\n\nStrong proposals will clearly articulate and support the above-noted areas within the proposal.\n:::\n\n  ",
