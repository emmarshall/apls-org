        <p>The American Psychology-Law Society (AP-LS) Committee on Early Career Professionals funds annually several grants of up to $5,000. The purpose of this award is to support AP-LS members who are ECPs (within 10 years of receiving their last degree) to conduct research related to psychology and law. These awards are not limited only to members who are psychologists; they are open to AP-LS members from all backgrounds. </p>
<p><strong>Award amounts</strong></p>
<p>Funding up to $5,000 per award is available.</p>
<p>Funding should primarily support research activities and data collection efforts (e.g., equipment, participant payments, software data transcription, hourly payment for research assistants, and expenses incurred at sites away from the home institution while collecting data). Travel to conferences and salary expenses are not eligible costs. Funds for successful proposals will be awarded to the PI’s academic institution (via the institution’s Office of Sponsored Research or Foundation). No institutional indirect cost recovery will be permitted.</p>

          <li><p> Applicants are encouraged but not required to secure matched funding from employers to support the proposed research.</p></li>
            <li><p> All applicants and any co-applicants must be active members of AP-LS. </p></li>
