        <p>REC disparities in the criminal justice system (CJS) necessitate that practicing psychologists working in the field of psychology and the law use their knowledge and experience to combat them. Practitioners are in a unique position to offer education, assessment, intervention and advocacy on issues of REC disparities, racism, and discrimination in the field of psychology and the law. However, a limited body of research, lack of practice guidelines on REC integration in forensic practice, and low representation of Black, Indigenous, People Of Color (BIPOC) professionals, limit such efforts. Mentorship of emerging practitioners in psychology and the law on such issues can bridge the gap of knowledge, application, and BIPOC representation in the field. </p>
        <p> The AP-LS Practice Committee wants to recognize the substantive contributions of practitioner mentors who educate and support emerging clinicians in psychology and the law with a lens toward the elimination of REC disparities and social justice. For these purposes, we use Goldstein’s (2007) definition of the practice of psychology and the law: “The application of psychological research, theory, practice, and traditional and specialized methodology (e.g. interviewing, psychological testing, forensic assessment, and forensically relevant instruments) to provide information relevant to a legal question.”</p>
        <p> The award for Outstanding Practitioner Mentoring to Eliminate Racial, Ethnic and Cultural (REC) Disparities in the Field of Psychology and the Law, will be conferred on a yearly basis. The recipient will receive a $500 cash award, a plaque to be presented at the annual AP-LS conference, and will be featured in an AP-LS newsletter article, written by the practice committee, highlighting the recipient’s achievements and recommendations to other practitioners. Highlighting the recipient's mentorship practices and experiences can serve as a model for other professionals in the field of psychology and the law.</p>

      <p> The award will recognize a practitioner mentor of any career stage who has excelled in their focus to educate, advocate and eliminate REC disparities in the field of psychology and the law. To be eligible for the award, individuals must have a doctoral degree (PhD, PsyD, EdD), self-identify as a predominantly practicing forensic psychologist (about 75% of their work) and have a track record of excellence conducting mentorship of emerging forensic practitioners. Namely, the mentorship of graduate students, postdoctoral trainees, or early career professionals preparing for a career in direct service provision.

</p>
            <p> The mentorship can be formal (e.g. an assigned clinical supervisor or mentor in a training program or place of work). It can also be so-called “informal mentorship” where the mentor has dedicated their personal time to assist and support emerging clinicians outside formal institutional affiliations (e.g. an African American forensic psychologist who regularly mentors other BIPOC early career psychologists in their area). Excellence in mentorship can take many shapes and forms. A common thread would be mentoring emerging clinicians, regardless of race or ethnicity, on using their specialized skills and knowledge as forensic psychologists to reduce REC disparities. The practitioner’s mentorship has had a significant impact in the system in which they operate (e.g. supporting increased training opportunities on BIPOC issues, helping increase BIPOC representation in the field of psychology and the law, supporting antiracist professional identities for emerging forensic psychologists).
