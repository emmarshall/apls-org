        <p>The purpose of the Diversity in Psychology and Law Research Awards is to promote diversity within the American Psychology-Law Society by supporting student research on psycholegal issues related to diversity as well as research by students from underrepresented groups. Projects are eligible for consideration for this award if they investigate topics related to psychology, law, diversity, and/or multiculturalism (e.g., research pertaining to psycholegal issues on race, gender, culture, sexual orientation, etc.), or if the principal investigator is a member of an underrepresented group, including racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and students with disabilities. Consistent with the mission of the BRIDGE Committee, these awards are intended to facilitate the research of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in AP-LS, as well as research about issues of potential interest and importance to such groups.  </p>
<p> This award is not intended to be used to fund conference travel cost. If assistance is needed with funding travel costs to the AP-LS Conference, students should consider applying for the Diversity Travel Awards[insert link]. Please be aware that students can only receive funding from one BRIDGE program/award per year.</p>
<p><strong>Award amounts</strong></p>
<p>Up to five mini-grants in the amount of $1,000 each will be awarded, with an option to divide two of the awards into two $500 mini-grants.</p>
