The AP-LS Professional Development of Women Committee is thrilled to offer Caregiving Grants of $500-$750 for 20-30 attendees of APLS Annual Conference, with priority to first authors, presenters, students, and early career professionals. 

This grant is open to any APLS member (student and non-student) who serves as a caregiver in any capacity (e.g., child, parent). Funds can be used for any caregiving needs during the conference, including needs at the conference or at home.

 
We will notify grantees by early February.
