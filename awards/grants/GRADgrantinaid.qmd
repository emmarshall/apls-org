## Eligibility
The Division 41 Graduate Student Grants-in-Aid Committee is accepting proposals for small grants (maximum of $2,000) to support empirical graduate research that addresses psycholegal issues.

This award is limited to graduate students who are  members of AP-LS. 

-   Awards are limited to current graduate students who are active [Student Affiliate](../../membership/index.qmd) members of AP-LS.

-   Applicants may submit only one application (either AP-LS Grants in Aid for Graduate Students or Grant in Aid for Graduate Students MacArthur Award) per funding cycle.

-   Research projects identified in proposals should request funding needed to complete future or early active research projects. Proposed funding requests for reimbursement of past research expenses of completed projects are not eligible.

-   Research projects identified in proposals are required to have active ethical approval from the host research institution(s) before the submission deadline. Proof of ethical (IRB) approval must be submitted along with the proposal document for an application to be deemed complete and eligible for review by the Grants in Aid Committee. Any proposed research project without notification of ethical approval before the submission deadline will be considered ineligible for the award.

-   The maximum for any individual award is set at $2,000. Any requests for funding beyond $2,000 will not be considered. Proposed research projects with an anticipated budget of over $2,000 should identify within the proposal the plan for covering the remaining costs to demonstrate that the research is feasible.

-   Applicants who previously submitted a Grant in Aid proposal that was not selected for funding are permitted to revise and resubmit their proposal for consideration during the next funding cycle.

-   Applicants who previously received Grants in Aid funding from the committee are eligible to apply for the award again to fund a new research project provided that the research from the previous award has been completed. Past award winners must include an abstract (200 words or fewer) in their proposal application that succinctly summarizes the previous research funded by the award.

## How to Apply

Interested individuals should submit a complete award application via the AP-LS proposal management system by 11:59 p.m. PST on the date of the identified submission deadline. 

Annual application deadlines are **October 15** and **February 15**.

A complete Grant in Aid application includes:

-   A short grant proposal (see proposal instructions and guidelines below)
 
-   Documentation of active IRB approval status for the proposed research project from the host research institution(s)

-   Completed appropriate tax form: W-9 tax form for U.S. citizens and W-8BEN tax form for international students


## Proposal Instructions and Guidelines

Applicants are to provide a short grant proposal (a maximum of 2,000 words excluding abstract and references) that includes:

1. A **cover sheet** indicating the title of the project, name, address, phone number, and email address of the investigator
</li></p> 

2. An **abstract** of 200 words or less summarizing the project

3. **Project background** that reviews purpose, theoretical rationale, and significance of the project

4. **Project method** that provides a detailed description of the project’s participants, design, materials, and/or procedures to be employed

5. **Budget and justification** that identifies the specific amount requested, including a detailed project budget and justification for expenses as needed
6. **References**

Proposal documents should be formatted according to the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, Seventh Edition, and submitted in an electronic format (preferably MS Word or PDF).

Applicants who previously received Grants-in-Aid funding from the committee must include an additional abstract (200 words or less) in their proposal application that succinctly summarizes the previous research funded by the award.

Budget items typically funded include (but are not limited to) payment of subjects, photocopying, purchase of testing materials, software not typically provided via universities and electronic media. The committee does not typically provide funds for computers (though peripherals may be funded), office supplies and furniture (e.g., file cabinets), mileage, paying research assistants and software, or equipment typically available within universities. Conference and other travel costs are not funded.

Proposed research projects with an anticipated budget of over $2,000 should explain in the budget how these additional project costs intend to be covered. Projects requesting funding for payment of subjects should provide appropriate justification for both the number of participants being requested (e.g., a power analysis) and the amount of compensation being awarded for each participant. Projects requesting funding for payment of subjects from online sources (MTurk, Qualtrics panels, etc.) should provide justification for the amount of compensation being provided to subjects and account for any overhead costs charged by the site for using their services within the budget.

## Proposal Review Criteria
The Grants in Aid Committee will review and evaluate your project proposal based on the following criteria:

-   **Relevancy:** The proposed research clearly addresses practice, research, and/or public policy directly relevant to the field of psychology and law.

-   **Impact:** The proposed research will have meaning for the field of psychology and law, or contribute significantly to theory or knowledge on such topics.

-   **Rationale:** The proposed research includes a sound, thoughtful, and logical rationale for the proposed project; the logic of the proposal and literature review is clear and strong; the proposed method flows from the rationale itself.

-   **Methodology:** The proposed research provides a complete and clear description of the sample, design, and procedure to be employed that demonstrates a sound research strategy appropriate to answer the research question(s).

-   **Open Science:** The proposed research employs practices that increase the transparency and accessibility of the science itself, such as (but not limited to): pre-registering hypotheses, making code and data easily accessible, or having a broad plan for disseminating findings.

-   **Feasibility:** The proposed research can realistically be completed by students as outlined in the proposal based on the planned time, sample accessibility, materials, supports, and applicant’s research training and abilities.

-   **Budget:** The requested budget items are critical to the completion of the project, clearly detailed, justified and within the scope of the identified items traditionally funded by the Grants-in-Aid Committee. If the student is paying online participants, the fees are adequately calculated and appropriate for the amount of time participants spend.

Strong proposals will clearly articulate and support the relevancy, innovation, methodology, and feasibility of the research within the background and method of the proposal.
