AP-LS/Div. 41 is seeking nominations (including self-nominations) for fellow status.

### Become a Fellow
For members interested in advancement of psychology as a science and as a profession
Fellowship is a special distinction for members who have received a doctoral degree in psychology or a related field from a regionally accredited institution and can show evidence of unusual and outstanding contributions in the field of psychology.

Application for fellow status is open to any APA member who meets the criteria of both the sponsoring division and APA. Each division establishes its own criteria for nominations â€” sometimes the same as APA criteria, but usually involving additional requisites relevant to that division. Each division is responsible for providing the Fellows Committee with updated division criteria.

-   Five years of acceptable professional experience subsequent to the granting of the doctoral degree.
