For more information about the awards, eligibility, and how to nominate yourself or others, please click: Teaching and Mentoring Awards This year the TTC Committee is specifically soliciting nominations for individuals from a program/department that is undergraduate-only or MA-terminus (i.e., Category 2).

Winners will be announced at the 2024 AP-LS Conference. Award recipients receive \$500, a plaque at the AP-LS conference, and the option to serve as a guest columnist for the AP-LS Newsletter.

### Practice Committee's Mentorship Award: Call for Nominations

The Practice Committee's Award for Outstanding Practitioner Mentoring for the Elimination of Racial, Ethnic, and Cultural (REC) Disparities recognizes practitioners whose mentorship helps reduce REC disparities in psychology and the law. Practitioners are in a unique position to offer education, assessment, intervention and advocacy on issues of REC disparities, racism, and discrimination in the legal systems. However, a limited body of research, lack of practice guidelines on REC integration in forensic practice, and low representation of Black, Indigenous, People Of Color (BIPOC) professionals, limit such efforts. Mentorship of emerging practitioners in psychology and the law on such issues can bridge the gap of knowledge, application, and BIPOC representation in the field.

The Practice Committee is currently accepting award nominations for 2024. Additional information about the award can be found at: https://ap-ls.org/awards/. Nomination packages are due January 15th and should be emailed to the chair of the award subcommittee at practice\@ap-ls.org.

### Keep AP-LS'S Voice Heard at APA

Members of the American Psychological Association (APA) should receive their 2023 APA Ballot via e-mail on November 1. It is important that you promptly vote to keep AP-LS's voice heard within APA.

The ballot will include votes on APA bylaws changes and an apportionment ballot which determines how many voting members AP-LS gets on APA's governing body, the Council of Representatives (Council). In the past year, your AP-LS Council representatives (Margaret Bull Kovera and Jason Cantone) successfully passed APA legislation regarding the removal of mental health treatment questions from bar exam character and fitness examinations and submitted legislation for APA to oppose involuntary solitary confinement of juveniles in justice settings as well as legislation to better support parents with disabilities, including in child custody and foster care settings.

Each APA voting member is given 10 apportionment votes to allot across APA divisions and state provincial and territorial psychological associations (SPTAs). We ask that you give all ten of your votes to Division 41 / AP-LS. With more votes, we can obtain a third AP-LS Council representative seat to better address the many research and practice issues that matter to AP-LS. Please make sure to vote! If you are an APA member and do not receive an apportionment ballot, contact elections\@apa.org.

### Clinicians' Travel Grants: Call for Applications

I.  Description:

    The Practice Committee is sponsoring twenty (20) Clinicians' Travel Grants (CTG) to address disparities in access to funds available to clinicians to attend the AP-LS conference.

    Psychologists in academia often have paid time off and can receive university sponsored funds to cover costs associated with attending conferences. On the other hand, practitioners, especially those who work solely in private practice, often lack comparable levels of support. In addition to the costs associated with travel, clinicians may incur a loss of income when they attend a conference. The CTG will address the unique financial barriers clinicians face that make it difficult for them to attend the conference.

II. Eligibility:

    Eligible individuals must be AP-LS members. Any practicing psychologist, starting from the Post-Doctoral, Early Career, Mid and Advanced career level, may apply. The applicants will have to self-identify as primarily practicing psychologists (defined below) in the field of psychology and the law. For this purpose, a practicing clinician spends at least 75% of their work week providing direct services associated with psychology and the law or they are in a postdoctoral program training to become a practitioner in the area of psychology and the law.

    Preference will be given to psychologists at any level who do not have or have limited institutional support to attend conferences, such as private practitioners or practitioners in public non-academic institutions. Special preference may be given to practicing psychologists who are presenting at the conference and have not previously been granted the grant. The funds shall be used for travel costs associated with attending the AP-LS conference exclusively.

III. Degree of support:

     The maximum amount of support provided by the grant will vary depending on the amount of support needed or requested. It will also depend on the applicant's stage of career:

     -   Post-doctoral applicants may apply for a \$600 maximum amount of support.

     -   Early-career applicants may apply for a \$500 maximum amount of support.

     -   Mid to Advanced Career applicants may apply for a \$400 maximum amount of support.

IV. Application Process:

<!-- -->

1.  Applications are due by December 1, 2023
2.  Complete the CTG application at: tinyurl.com/CTGapplication

V. Contact practice\@ap-ls.org, if you have any questions.
