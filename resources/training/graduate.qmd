Programs are listed alphabetically by degree type: doctoral programs (PhD and PsyD), joint programs (PhD/JD, PsyD/JD, JD/MA, PhD/MLS), and masters-level programs.

Each program is described using the same categories (program facts, admission criteria, opportunities for research or practical and funding availability) to help prospective students make informed choices about graduate training and education in psychology and law.
