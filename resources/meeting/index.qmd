  A brief explaination of why we made a new website and how it can help AP-LS provide more dynamic content to its membership.

## Did AP-LS really need a new Website?

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## BUT...

-   We paid for many advanced tools & features we never used/needed

-   The new features they developed and introduce were largely irrelevant to us -- i.e., did not target an academic or scientific audience

-   Allowed for embedding/hosting docs/resources, but provided few options for indexing dynamic content without python or advance js knowledge

-   No option for version control

### ...and APA's site structure was well suited to serve AP-LS...

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## BUT...

-   We still lacked control over look/feel of the site

-   Slow response time made it difficult to add/remove dynamic content

-   Content sometimes lost in translation between web editor and APA web professionals

-   No option for version control

## Welcome to the new `ap-ls.org`!

This new [ap-ls.org website](https://ap-ls.netlify.app/) is built entirely in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) using [Quarto](https://quarto.org).

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## What is Quarto速?

[Quarto速](https://quarto.org) is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc.

-   Designed with a scientific publishing audience in mind by Posit速 (formerly RStudio)

-   Makes it easy to incorporate reproducible content

-   Allows documents to be rendered in multiple formats including reports, presentations, websites or books in html, pdf, word, etc.

-   Includes features tailored to academic and scientific writing or resources

    -   Makes it easy to do things like execute code in `r` or `python` or include citations, footnotes, scientific markdown, equations, citations, crossrefs, etc with minimal programming knowledge.

## How this website works

The site is published using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

We are currently using the free version of Netlify but can upgrade to the paid alternative if we want more advanced features like password protected pages.

We also do not currently have google analytics or other tracking set up on the site. That can change if you want it to.
:::

The content for the site is stored in the shared AP-LS Google Drive and the pages for the site are all stored on [GitHub](https://github.com).

### Making things easier

-   With git and version control we can spend less time maintaining a better record of what charges are made and when (and by whom).

-   By storing the content for our site in the shared `googledrive` we can streamline the process of making annual updates and also present more dynamic content on our pages.

## Example 1: Executive Committee

![Contact information for the 2022-2023 Executive Officers and Committee pages is now stored in a spreadsheet](images/leadership.png){fig-alt="Image of a spreadsheet will contact information" fig-align="center" width="472"}

To update the new directory page for next year, you just have to create a duplicate spreadsheet and provide the updated url to the code block within the `leadership.qmd` or `committees.qmd` file.

The information will be read into `r` and formatted for publication on the site:

#### For additional information about how this workflow can be used to make interactive tables: see [Committees](../../about/committees.html) or [Conference schedule](../../conferences/schedule.html)


## Example 2: Pets!

We can also use a similar process to collect and share content solicited from our membership.

Take a look at the newly renovated [Pets of AP-LS](../pets/index.html) blog post page. This is a project of the Student Committee and is now set up to generate a new post whenever someone submits a new pet via the associated google form.

When we receive a new pet, the data will be read into `r` and generate a new `index.qmd` template file with those details.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| column: page
#| fig-subcap: 
#| - "Here is the form"
#| - "... here is the yaml header that is automatically generated"

knitr::include_graphics("images/form.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/yml.png")
```

Once we confirm and approve that the submission is legitimate, we can render the doc and add it to our site.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| column: page
#| fig-cap: "... and here is a very cute pup"
knitr::include_graphics("images/fitz.png")
```
