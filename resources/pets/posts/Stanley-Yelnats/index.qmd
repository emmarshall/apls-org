  Born in Florida, raised in Vermont, and now a full-time New Yorker, Stanley is always finding new ways to get into trouble. Frequently referred to as ""The Bandit,"" he is constantly trying to steal food and socks. He knows he can get away with it using a combination of insane puppy dog eyes and apologetic cuddles.
