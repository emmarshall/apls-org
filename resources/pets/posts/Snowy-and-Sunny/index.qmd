age: "Andy = 16, Ebony = 7ish?"
talent: |
  Sunny likes to go swimming and enjoys riding in a kayak or on a paddle board. Snowy mostly just sleeps.
habit: |
  The vet recently asked if Ebony is an "indiscriminate eater." Yes, yes she is. Acorns? Yum! Roadkill? Sure! Is that garbage? I'll taste it!  Andy is older than time and must be respected as such. He resents any suggestion that he could possibly have a bad habit.
