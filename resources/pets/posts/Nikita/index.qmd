  Nikita is a five year old tuxedo cat that has quite the personality! She loves to “talk” and practically narrates everything she does. She loves to be around people, and is the most affectionate cat I have ever met. If she’s not in the window looking for birds, you will find her cuddling with her sister, Nani, or helping out with my research (see pictures).
