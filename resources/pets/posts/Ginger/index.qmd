human: Alexandra Zidenberg, M.A., PhD (Cand.), University of Saskatchewan
description: |
  Ginger originally hails from British Colombia and moved to Ontario when she was one year old. She lived happily in Ontario until her human got accepted into a PhD program halfway across the country in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Now, Ginger lives happily with her human in Saskatoon. Ginger does not love that the winters in Saskatoon routinely involve temperatures of -40 but she refuses to wear a sweater. Instead, she settles for snuggling up in blankets and sitting on radiators..
