  Smokey had been abandoned in the woods when I found her on a camping trip. I carried her two miles back to our campsite and sheâ€™s been with us ever since. She now enjoys a charmed life. Smokey goes on hops through our garden and feasts on cilantro and kale. She also enjoys an occasional hop through the snow when it gets chilly. Her favorite treat is tortilla chips.
