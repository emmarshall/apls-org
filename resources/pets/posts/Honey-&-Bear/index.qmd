  Honey and Bear are related, but polar opposites. Honey is the bees knees (it is no surprise her nickname is sweet cheeks). Bear is a teddy but can be a bit grizzly. Nevertheless, we could not bear to be without him. He is our self-appointed guard dog and somehow managed to get the nickname “big boobs”. Honey & Bear are best buds. They love to wrestle outside and bite each other’s wrinkles off. Fighting one bulldog stereotype at a time, Honey & Bear love to hike and have recently picked up agility training. When this choir is asleep, the harmonious snores fill our household like a beautiful symphony.
