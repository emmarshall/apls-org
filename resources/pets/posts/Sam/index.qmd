  Sam is a sweet, fun-loving girl who was found on the streets of Philly as a kitten when I was in grad school! I adopted her when she was eight weeks old and she has come with me on my moves and adventures over the last six years. She is so sociable and people friendly that I think she sometimes forgets she is a cat ;-)
