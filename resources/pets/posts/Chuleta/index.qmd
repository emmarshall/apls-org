title: Chuleta
human: Emily Gottfried, PhD; Medical University of South Carolina
description: |
  Chuleta was adopted from a "kill shelter" in Chipley, Florida when I was a grad student at Florida State in 2009. She was a tiny puppy and we had no idea what breed she was or how big she would get. Since her time in Tallahassee, she has moved across the country with me: FL to CA to GA to SC and has been a great travel companion, hiking partner, and all around best friend!!

  At home, Chuleta is the "alpha" and I think she believes I'm her pet. She's really nervous in public and a vet once told me that I must be "her person" and that she can "be her [alpha] self" around me!
