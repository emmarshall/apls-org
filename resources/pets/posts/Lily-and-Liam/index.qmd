title: Lily and Liam
human: Cait Cavanagh, Assistant Professor, Michigan State University

  Lily (blue eyes) and Liam (green eyes) are brother/sister littermates-- even though they don't look very similar! They are pair bonded, which means they love to cuddle and hate being separated. I adopted them as a grad student, so from the beginning they have ben excellent helpers when I analyze data or write.
