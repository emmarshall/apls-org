title: Doug
human: Haley Potts, M.A., psych/law graduate student at the University of Alabama
description: |
  Doug was abandoned at a sheep farm because he was bad at herding sheep. This makes a lot of sense to us, because his personality is not very assertive. He is very sweet, mild-mannered, food motivated, and spoiled rotten.
quote: |
  "Excuse me, everyone, but I am very hungry, please help" - my fiance's impersonation of what Doug's best man speech will be

age: "Andy = 16, Ebony = 7ish?"
talent: |
  being hungry 24/7, getting the zoomies, being enormous
habit: |
  begging for food, barking at elderly people on their morning walks, doing a terrible job at herding sheep
