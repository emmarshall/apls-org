human: Morgan Wagner
description: |
  Phinneas was adopted from Green Bay, WI when he was three months old and has been spoiled ever since. He has tons of energy but loves cuddles and napping. He is also very needy and is always within paws reach when mom is studying- he will arguably be smarter than she is by the end of her PhD program with how much he loves her notes and textbooks!
