  abstract = {The Roots of Modern Psychology and Law               offers the personal narratives of 12 contributors to this field during the 1970s and 1980s, the decades following the birth of the American Psychology\textendash Law Society in 1969. The first chapter describes the evolution of the field from its earliest roots at the beginning of the 20th century to the present. The field was dormant in the mid-20th century, then blossomed about 50 years ago. The 12 primary chapters are written by psychologists who created the seminal works on which the field was built for the most recent 50 years. For their own research or practice specialties, they describe the state of the modern field of psychology and law when it emerged in the 1970s, how they were led to try to apply psychology to law, their earliest works in that area, and how those works stimulated the evolution of research and practice in the areas they had first explored. Each chapter traces that evolution to the present and offers reflections on the future of their subfield within psychology and law.},
