She now enjoys a charmed life. Smokey goes on hops through our garden and feasts on cilantro and kale. She also enjoys an occasional hop through the snow when it gets chilly. Her favorite treat is tortilla chips."

Some barriers faced by people seeking to enter the field are shared with other subfields of psychology whereas others are unique to corrections. The purpose of this interactive workshop was to highlight some of the potential causes of the lack of diversity, particularly racial and ethnic diversity, in the field and to offer some potential solutions to this problem. Panelists provided suggestions on how to improve recruitment and retention of diverse people in academic, research, and clinical settings. In addition, strategies that individuals can use to address discrimination in their academic or work settings were discussed.\nSponsored by:\nAP-LS Corrections Committee, AP-LS BRIDGE Committee and ICPF"

    "text": "The field of psychology has embraced video communication technologies (VCT) in an effort to match existing social norms and reach clients who may otherwise have limited options for local providers, face increased costs and lost wages for travel to clinics, or go without services altogether. Beyond this, remote technologies have become a necessity following the COVID-19 pandemic for sustaining clinical practices and safely engaging clients. VCT is exploding across the globe, with many considering it as a sort of savior in the fight to resolve the mental health crisis.\nGiven the high demand for pre-trial evaluations (Antonacci, et al., 2008; Deslich et al., 2013), rural location of many correctional facilities, and increased risk of infection in total confinement, the use of VCT is increasingly used to assess and treat justice-involved persons. While commentary and research are emerging (see e.g., Batastini et al., 2016; Luxton & Lexcen, 2018), practitioners, scholars, and policymakers remain in need of clear guidance for improving the efficiency and quality of telecare.\nThis program includes a multidisciplinary group of panelists who will provide real-world examples, interactive critical thinking exercises, and empirically driven recommendations that will not only interest those working within the legal system, but also those broadly looking to integrate telepsychology into their practice or research program. Panelists will cover topics including establishing a remote jail-based competency restoration program, improving the science of conducting and reporting forensic telepsychology initiatives, overcoming unique barriers to privacy and confidentiality in carceral settings, developing an infrastructure for telehealth networks, and drafting discipline-specific best practice guidelines. Embedded within these talks, panelists will also address considerations for rural and diverse clients. The session will conclude with a general discussion and Q&A with the panelists using pre-selected questions. APA Divisions supporting this program include: 12, 14, 18, 41 (lead division), 42, and 46.\nPresenters:\n\nAshley B. Batastini, Ph.D.- University of Memphis\nTomina J.

    "text": "This engaging panel on Law & Psychology includes an overview of the field and presents six psychologists who conduct research and practice at the intersection of psychology and the law.\nPanelists include: Margaret Bull Kovera, PhD; Jemour Maddux, PsyD, ABPP; Natalie Anumba, PhD; Jason A. Cantone, JD, PhD; Apryl Alexander, PsyD; Jason Lawrence, PhD; and Dennis Stolle, JD, PhD.\nPanelists use their background in psychology to educate attorneys, judges, and juries on the role of psychology to reduce bias, increase cooperation, ensure procedural fairness, and understand psychological evidence including eyewitness testimony. Clinical forensic psychologists conduct evaluations of harm, risk, and abilities such as competency to stand trial or criminal responsibility in family, civil, sentencing, and criminal cases; they may work with survivors of violence as well as offenders to ensure public safety, reduce recidivism, and prevent offenses. Panelists provide guidance about graduate education and deciding on a career in psychology and law.\n\n Link to video"

    "text": "1.01 Integrity Forensic practitioners strive for accuracy, honesty, and truthfulness in the science, teaching, and practice of forensic psychology and they strive to resist partisan pressures to provide services in any ways that might tend to be misleading or inaccurate.\n1.02 Impartiality and Fairness When offering expert opinion to be relied upon by a decision maker, providing forensic therapeutic services, or teaching or conducting research, forensic practitioners strive for accuracy, impartiality, fairness, and independence (EPPCC Standard 2.01). Forensic practitioners recognize the adversarial nature of the legal system and strive to treat all participants and weigh all data, opinions, and rival hypotheses impartially.\nWhen conducting forensic examinations, forensic practitioners strive to be unbiased and impartial, and avoid partisan presentation of unrepresentative, incomplete, or inaccurate evidence that might mislead finders of fact. This guideline does not preclude forceful presentation of the data and reasoning upon which a conclusion or professional product is based.\nWhen providing educational services, forensic practitioners seek to represent alternative perspectives, including data, studies, or evidence on both sides of the question, in an accurate, fair and professional manner, and strive to weigh and present all views, facts, or opinions impartially.\nWhen conducting research, forensic practitioners seek to represent results in a fair and impartial manner. Forensic practitioners strive to utilize research designs and scientific methods that adequately and fairly test the questions at hand, and they attempt to resist partisan pressures to develop designs or report results in ways that might be misleading or unfairly bias the results of a test, study, or evaluation.\n1.03 Avoiding Conflicts of Interest Forensic practitioners refrain from taking on a professional role when personal, scientific, professional, legal, financial, or other interests or relationships could reasonably be expected to impair their impartiality, competence, or effectiveness, or expose others with whom a professional relationship exists to harm (EPPCC Standard 3.06).\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to identify, make known, and address real or apparent conflicts of interest in an attempt to maintain the public confidence and trust, discharge professional obligations, and maintain responsibility, impartiality, and accountability (EPPCC Standard 3.06). Whenever possible, such conflicts are revealed to all parties as soon as they become known to the psychologist. Forensic practitioners consider whether a prudent and competent forensic practitioner engaged in similar circumstances would determine that the ability to make a proper decision is likely to become impaired under the immediate circumstances.\nWhen a conflict of interest is determined to be manageable, continuing services are provided and documented in a way to manage the conflict, maintain accountability, and preserve the trust of relevant others (also see Section 4.02 below)."

    "text": "11.01 Accuracy, Fairness, and Avoidance of Deception\nForensic practitioners make reasonable efforts to ensure that the products of their services, as well as their own public statements and professional reports and testimony, are communicated in ways that promote understanding and avoid deception (EPPCC Standard 5.01).\nWhen in their role as expert to the court or other tribunals, the role of forensic practitioners is to facilitate understanding of the evidence or dispute.\nConsistent with legal and ethical requirements, forensic practitioners do not distort or withhold relevant evidence or opinion in reports or testimony. When responding to discovery requests and providing sworn testimony, forensic practitioners strive to have readily available for inspection all data which they considered, regardless of whether the data supports their opinion, subject to and consistent with court order, relevant rules of evidence, test security issues, and professional standards (American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, in press; American Psychological Association Committee on Legal Issues, 2006; Bank & Packer, 2007; Golding, 1990).\nWhen providing reports and other sworn statements or testimony in any form, forensic practitioners strive to present their conclusions, evidence, opinions, or other professional products in a fair manner. Forensic practitioners do not, by either commission or omission, participate in misrepresentation of their evidence, nor do they participate in partisan attempts to avoid, deny or subvert the presentation of evidence contrary to their own position or opinion (EPPCC Standard 5.01). This does not preclude forensic practitioners from forcefully presenting the data and reasoning upon which a conclusion or professional product is based.\n\n\n11.02 Differentiating Observations, Inferences, and Conclusions\nIn their communications, forensic practitioners strive to distinguish observations, inferences, and conclusions. Forensic practitioners are encouraged to explain the relationship between their expert opinions and the legal issues and facts of the case at hand.\n\n\n11.03 Disclosing Sources of Information and Bases of Opinions\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to disclose all sources of information obtained in the course of their professional services, and to identify the source of each piece of information that was considered and relied upon in formulating a particular conclusion, opinion or other professional product.\n\n\n11.04 Comprehensive and Accurate Presentation of Opinions in Reports and Testimony\nConsistent with relevant law and rules of evidence, when providing professional reports and other sworn statements or testimony, forensic practitioners strive to offer a complete statement of all relevant opinions that they formed within the scope of their work on the case, the basis and reasoning underlying the opinions, the salient data or other information that was considered in forming the opinions, and an indication of any additional evidence that may be used in support of the opinions to be offered. The specific substance of forensic reports is determined by the type of psycholegal issue at hand as well as relevant laws or rules in the jurisdiction in which the work is completed.\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to limit discussion of background information that does not bear directly upon the legal purpose of the examination or consultation. Forensic practitioners avoid offering information that is irrelevant and that does not provide a substantial basis of support for their opinions, except when required by law (EPPCC Standard 4.04).\n\n\n11.05 Commenting Upon Other Professionals and Participants in Legal Proceedings\nWhen evaluating or commenting upon the work or qualifications of other professionals involved in legal proceedings, forensic practitioners seek to represent their disagreements in a professional and respectful tone, and base them on a fair examination of the data, theories, standards and opinions of the other expert or party.\nWhen describing or commenting upon clients, examinees, or other participants in legal proceedings, forensic practitioners strive to do so in a fair and impartial manner. Forensic practitioners strive to report the representations, opinions, and statements of clients, examinees, or other participants in a fair and impartial manner.\n\n\n11.06 Out of Court Statements\nOrdinarily, forensic practitioners seek to avoid making detailed public (out-of-court) statements about legal proceedings in which they have been involved. However, sometimes public statements may serve important goals such as educating the public about the role of forensic practitioners in the legal system, the appropriate practice of forensic psychology, and psychological and legal issues that are relevant to the matter at hand. When making public statements, forensic practitioners refrain from releasing private, confidential, or privileged information, and attempt to protect persons from harm, misuse, or misrepresentation as a result of their statements (EPPCC Standard 4.05).\n\n\n11.07 Commenting Upon Legal Proceedings\nForensic practitioners strive to address particular legal proceedings in publications or communications only to the extent that the information relied upon is part of a public record, or when consent for that use has been properly obtained from any party holding any relevant privilege (also see Section 8.04).\nWhen offering public statements about specific cases in which they have not been involved, forensic practitioners offer opinions for which there is sufficient information or data and make clear the limitations of their statements and opinions resulting from having had no direct knowledge of or involvement with the case (EPPCC Standard 9.01)."

    "text": "5.01 Determining Fees\nWhen determining fees forensic practitioners may consider salient factors such as their experience providing the service, the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, the skill required to perform the service, the fee customarily charged for similar forensic services, the likelihood that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment, the time limitations imposed by the client or circumstances, the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client, the client’s ability to pay for the service, and any legal requirements.\n\n\n5.02 Fee Arrangements\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to make clear to the client the likely cost of services whenever it is feasible, and make appropriate provisions in those cases in which the costs of services is greater than anticipated or the client’s ability to pay for services changes in some way.\nForensic practitioners seek to avoid undue influence that might result from financial compensation or other gains. Because of the threat to impartiality presented by the acceptance of contingent fees and associated legal prohibitions, forensic practitioners strive to avoid providing professional services on the basis of contingent fees. Letters of protection, financial guarantees, and other security for payment of fees in the future are not considered contingent fees unless payment is dependent on the outcome of the matter.\n\n\n5.03 Pro Bono Services\nForensic psychologists recognize that some persons may have limited access to legal services as a function of financial disadvantage and strive to contribute a portion of their professional time for little or no compensation or personal advantage (EPPCC Principle E)."

    "text": "The final version of the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists, prepared by the AP-LS Committee on the Revision of the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology, was adopted by APA Council of Representatives on Aug. 3, 2011.\nThe guidelines originally appeared in American Psychologist and are available to download.\n Download Forensic Guidelines .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAPA has approved an extension of the current APA specialty Guidelines in Forensic Psychology through December 31, 2026.\n\n\nFor other professional guidelines from APA, go here\n\nApplicationDefinitions & TerminologyBackground & History\n\n\nThe Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists applies as follows:\nFor the purposes of these Guidelines, forensic psychology refers to professional practice by any psychologist working within any sub-discipline of psychology (e.g., clinical, developmental, social, cognitive) when applying the scientific, technical, or specialized knowledge of psychology to the law to assist in addressing legal, contractual, and administrative matters. Application of the Guidelines does not depend on the practitioner’s typical areas of practice or expertise, but rather on the service provided in the case at hand. These Guidelines apply in all matters in which psychologists provide expertise to judicial, administrative, and educational systems including, but not limited to, examining or treating persons in anticipation of or subsequent to legal, contractual, administrative, proceedings; offering expert opinion about psychological issues in the form of amicus briefs or testimony to judicial, legislative or administrative bodies; acting in an adjudicative capacity; serving as a trial consultant or otherwise offering expertise to attorneys, the courts, or others; conducting research in connection with, or in the anticipation of, litigation; or involvement in educational activities of a forensic nature.\n\n\nFor the purposes of these Guidelines:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory of the Guidelines\nThe previous version of the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists (Committee on Ethical Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists, 1991) was approved by the American Psychology-Law Society, Division 41 of the American Psychological Association, and the American Academy of Forensic Psychology in 1991. The current revision, now called the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology (referred to as Guidelines throughout this document), replace the 1991 Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists.\n\n\nRevision Process\nThis revision of the Guidelines was coordinated by the Committee for the Revision of the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology, which was established by the American Academy of Forensic Psychology and the American Psychology-Law Society (Division 41 of the American Psychological Association) in 2002 and operated through 2011. This Committee consisted of two representatives from each organization (Solomon Fulero, PhD, JD, Stephen Golding, PhD, ABPP, Lisa Piechowski, PhD, ABPP, Christina Studebaker, PhD) a Chairperson (Randy Otto, PhD, ABPP), and a liaison from APA Division 42 (Jeffrey Younggren, PhD, ABPP).\nThis document was revised in accordance with American Psychological Association Rule 30.08 and the APA policy document Criteria for the development and evaluation of practice guidelines (APA, 2001). The Committee posted announcements regarding the revision process to relevant electronic discussion lists and professional publications (i.e., Psylaw-L email listserve, American Academy of Forensic Psychology listserve, American Psychology-Law Society Newsletter).\nIn addition, an electronic discussion list devoted solely to issues concerning revision of the Guidelines was operated between December 2002 and July 2007, followed by establishment of an e-mail address in February 2008 (sgfp@yahoo.com). Individuals were invited to provide input and commentary on the existing Guidelines and proposed revisions via these means. In addition, two public meetings were held throughout the revision process at biennial meetings of the American Psychology-Law Society.\nUpon development of a draft that the Revisions Committee deemed suitable, the revised Guidelines were submitted for review to the Executive Committee of the American Psychology-Law Society and Division 41 of the American Psychological Association, and to the American Board of Forensic Psychology.\nOnce the revised Guidelines were approved by these two organizations, they were submitted to the American Psychological Association for review, commentary, and acceptance, consistent with the American Psychological Association’s Criteria for Practice Guideline Development and Evaluation (Committee on Professional Practice and Standards, 2001) and Rule 30-8. They were subsequently revised by the Revisions Committee and were adopted by the American Psychological Association Council of Representatives on [insert date here].\n\n\nDevelopers and Support\nThe Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology were developed by the American Psychology-Law Society (Division 41 of the American Psychological Association) and the American Academy of Forensic Psychology.\n\n\nCurrent Status\nThese Guidelines are scheduled to expire [insert date here]. After this date, users are encouraged to contact the American Psychological Association Practice Directorate to confirm that this document remains in effect.\nSGFP Guidelines originally adopted in 1991 (PDF, 64KB)\n Download \nJanuary 2006 Draft of the Revised SGFP Guidelines (PDF, 87KB)\n Download \nFebruary 2008 Draft of the Revised SGFP Guidelines (PDF, 99KB)\n Download \nSeptember 2008 Draft of the Revised SGFP Guidelines (PDF, 91KB)\n Download \nAugust 2010 Draft of the Revised SGFP Guidelines (PDF, 169KB)\n Download"

    "text": "9.01 Use of Appropriate Methods\nForensic practitioners strive to utilize appropriate methods and procedures in their work. When performing examinations, treatment, consultation, educational activities or scholarly investigations, forensic practitioners seek to maintain integrity by examining the issue or problem at hand from all reasonable perspectives and seek information that will differentially test plausible rival hypotheses.\n\n\n9.02 Use of Multiple Sources of Information\nForensic practitioners ordinarily avoid relying solely on one source of data, and corroborate important data whenever feasible (American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, in press). When relying upon data that have not been corroborated, forensic practitioners seek to make known the uncorroborated status of the data, any associated strengths and limitations, and the reasons for relying upon the data.\n\n\n9.03 Opinions Regarding Persons Not Examined\nForensic practitioners recognize their obligations to only provide written or oral evidence about the psychological characteristics of particular individuals when they have sufficient information or data to form an adequate foundation for those opinions or to substantiate their findings (EPPCC Standard 9.01). Forensic practitioners seek to make reasonable efforts to obtain such information or data, and they document their efforts to obtain it. When it is not possible or feasible to examine individuals about whom they are offering an opinion, forensic practitioners strive to make clear the impact of such limitations on the reliability and validity of their professional products, opinions, or testimony.\nWhen conducting a record review or providing consultation or supervision that does not warrant an individual examination, forensic practitioners seek to identify the sources of information on which they are basing their opinions and recommendations, including any substantial limitations to their opinions and recommendations."

    "text": "3.01 Provision of Services\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to seek explicit agreements that define the scope of, time-frame of, and compensation for their services. In the event that a client breaches the contract or acts in a way that would require the practitioner to violate ethical, legal or professional obligations, the forensic practitioner may terminate the relationship.\nForensic practitioners strive to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in providing agreed-upon and reasonably anticipated services. Forensic practitioners are not bound, however, to provide services not reasonably anticipated when retained, nor to provide every possible aspect or variation of service. Instead, forensic practitioners may exercise professional discretion in determining the extent and means by which services are provided and agreements are fulfilled.\n\n\n3.02 Responsiveness\nForensic practitioners seek to manage their workloads so that services can be provided thoroughly, competently, and promptly. They recognize that acting with reasonable promptness, however, does not require the forensic practitioner to acquiesce to service demands not reasonably anticipated at the time the service was requested, nor does it require the forensic practitioner to provide services if the client has not acted in a manner consistent with existing agreements, including payment of fees.\n\n\n3.03 Communication\nForensic practitioners strive to keep their clients reasonably informed about the status of their services, comply with their clients’ reasonable requests for information, and consult with their clients about any substantial limitation on their conduct or performance that may arise when they reasonably believe that their clients expect a service that is not consistent with their professional obligations. Forensic practitioners attempt to keep their clients reasonably informed regarding new facts, opinions, or other potential evidence that may be relevant and applicable.\n\n\n3.04 Termination of Services\nThe forensic practitioner seeks to carry through to conclusion all matters undertaken for a client unless the forensic practitioner-client relationship is terminated. When a forensic practitioner’s employment is limited to a specific matter, the relationship may terminate when the matter has been resolved, anticipated services have been completed, or the agreement has been violated."

    "title": "Competence",
    "section": "",
    "text": "2.01 Scope of Competence\nWhen determining one’s competence to provide services in a particular matter, forensic practitioners may consider a variety of factors including the relative complexity and specialized nature of the service, relevant training and experience, the preparation and study they are able to devote to the matter, and the opportunity for consultation with a professional of established competence in the subject matter in question. Even with regard to subjects in which they are expert, forensic practitioners may choose to consult with colleagues.\n\n\n2.02 Gaining and Maintaining Competence\nCompetence can be acquired through various combinations of education, training, supervised experience, consultation, study, and professional experience. Forensic practitioners planning to provide services, teach, or conduct research involving populations, areas, techniques, or technologies that are new to them are encouraged to undertake relevant education, training, supervised experience, consultation, or study.\nForensic practitioners make ongoing efforts to develop and maintain their competencies (EPPCC Section 2.03). To maintain the requisite knowledge and skill, forensic practitioners keep abreast of developments in the fields of psychology and the law.\n\n\n2.03 Representing Competencies Consistent with the EPPCC\nForensic practitioners adequately and accurately inform all recipients of their services (e.g., attorneys, tribunals) about relevant aspects of the nature and extent of their experience, training, credentials, and qualifications, and how they were obtained (EPPCC Standard 5.01)\n\n\n2.04 Knowledge of the Legal System\nForensic practitioners recognize the importance of obtaining a fundamental and reasonable level of knowledge and understanding of the legal and professional standards, laws, rules, and precedents that govern their participation in legal proceedings and that guide the impact of their services on service recipients (EPPCC Standard 2.01).\nForensic practitioners aspire to manage their professional conduct in a manner that does not threaten or impair the rights of affected individuals. They may consult with, and refer others to, legal counsel on matters of law. Although they do not provide formal legal advice or opinions, forensic practitioners may provide information about the legal process to others based on their knowledge and experience. They strive to distinguish this from legal opinions, however, and encourage consultation with attorneys as appropriate.\n\n\n2.05 Knowledge of the Scientific Foundation for Opinions and Testimony\nForensic practitioners seek to provide opinions and testimony that are sufficiently based upon adequate scientific foundation, and reliable and valid principles and methods that have been applied appropriately to the facts of the case.\nWhen providing opinions and testimony that are based on novel or emerging principles and\nmethods, forensic practitioners seek to make known the status and limitations of these principles and methods.\n\n\n2.06 Knowledge of the Scientific Foundation for Teaching and Research\nForensic practitioners engage in teaching and research activities in which they have adequate knowledge, experience, and education (EPPCC Standard 2.01), and they acknowledge relevant limitations and caveats inherent in procedures and conclusions (EPPCC Standard 5.01).\n\n\n2.07 Considering the Impact of Personal Beliefs and Experience\nForensic practitioners recognize that their own cultures, attitudes, values, beliefs, opinions, or biases may affect their ability to practice in a competent and impartial manner. When such factors may diminish their ability to practice in a competent and impartial manner, forensic practitioners may take steps to correct or limit such effects, decline participation in the matter, or limit their participation in a manner that is consistent with professional obligations.\n\n\n2.08 Appreciation of Individual and Group Differences\nWhen scientific or professional knowledge in the discipline of psychology establishes that an understanding of factors associated with age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, language, socioeconomic status, or other relevant individual and cultural differences affects implementation or use of their services or research, forensic practitioners consider the boundaries of their expertise, make an appropriate referral if indicated, or gain the necessary training, experience, consultation, or supervision (EPPCC Standard 2.01, American Psychological Association, 2003; American Psychological Association, 2004; American Psychological Association, 2011c; American Psychological Association, in press; American Psychological Association Task Force on Guidelines for Assessment and Treatment of Persons with Disabilities, 2011).\nForensic practitioners strive to understand how factors associated with age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, language, socioeconomic status, or other relevant individual and cultural differences may affect and be related to the basis for people’s contact and involvement with the legal system.\nForensic practitioners do not engage in unfair discrimination based on such factors or on any basis proscribed by law (EPPCC Standard 3.01). They strive to take steps to correct or limit the effects of such factors on their work, decline participation in the matter, or limit their participation in a manner that is consistent with professional obligations.\n\n\n2.09 Appropriate Use of Services and Products\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to make reasonable efforts to guard against misuse of their services and exercise professional discretion in addressing such misuses."

    "text": "In the past 50 years forensic psychological practice had expanded dramatically. The American Psychological Association has a division devoted to matters of law and psychology (APA Division 41, the American Psychology-Law Society), a number of scientific journals devoted to interactions between psychology and the law exist (e.g., Law and Human Behavior, Psychology, Public Policy and Law, Behavioral Sciences and the Law), and a number of key texts have been published and undergone multiple revisions (e.g., Grisso, 1986, 2003; Melton, Petrila, Poythress, & Slobogin, 1987, 1997; Melton, Petrila, Poythress, Slobogin, Lyons, & Otto, 2007; Rogers, 1988, 1997, 2008).\nIn addition, training in forensic psychology is available in pre-doctoral, internship and post-doctoral settings, and the American Psychological Association recognized forensic psychology as a specialty in 2001, with subsequent re-certification in 2008.\nBecause the practice of forensic psychology differs in important ways from more traditional practice areas (Monahan, 1980) the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists were developed and published in 1991 (Committee on Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists, 1991). Because of continued developments in the field in the ensuing 20 years, forensic practitioners’ ongoing need for guidance, and policy requirements of the American Psychological Association, the 1991 Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists were revised, with the intent of benefiting forensic practitioners and recipients of their services alike.\nThe goals of these Guidelines are to improve the quality of forensic psychological services:\n\nenhance the practice and facilitate the systematic development of forensic psychology\nencourage a high level of quality in professional practice\nencourage forensic practitioners to acknowledge and respect the rights of those they serve\n\nThese Guidelines are intended for use by psychologists when engaged in the practice of forensic psychology as described below, and may also provide guidance on professional conduct to the legal system, and other organizations and professions.\nFor the purposes of these Guidelines, forensic psychology refers to professional practice by any psychologist working within any sub-discipline of psychology (e.g., clinical, developmental, social, cognitive) when applying the scientific, technical, or specialized knowledge of psychology to the law to assist in addressing legal, contractual, and administrative matters. Application of the Guidelines does not depend on the practitioner’s typical areas of practice or expertise, but rather on the service provided in the case at hand.\nThese Guidelines apply in all matters in which psychologists provide expertise to judicial, administrative, and educational systems including, but not limited to:\n\nexamining or treating persons in anticipation of or subsequent to legal, contractual, administrative, proceedings\noffering expert opinion about psychological issues in the form of amicus briefs or testimony to judicial, legislative or administrative bodies\nacting in an adjudicative capacity; serving as a trial consultant or otherwise offering expertise to attorneys, the courts, or others\nconducting research in connection with, or in the anticipation of, litigation\nor involvement in educational activities of a forensic nature\n\nPsychological practice is not considered forensic solely because the conduct takes place in, or the product is presented in, a tribunal or other judicial, legislative, or administrative forum.\n\nFor example, when a party (such as a civilly or criminally detained individual) or another individual (such as a child whose parents are involved in divorce proceedings) is ordered into treatment with a practitioner, that treatment is not necessarily the practice of forensic psychology. In addition, psychological testimony that is solely based on the provision of psychotherapy and does not include psycholegal opinions is not ordinarily considered forensic practice.\n\nFor the purposes of these Guidelines, “forensic practitioner” refers to a psychologist when engaged in the practice of forensic psychology as described above. Such professional conduct is considered forensic from the time the practitioner reasonably expects to, agrees to, or is legally mandated to, provide expertise on an explicitly psycholegal issue.\nThe provision of forensic services may include a wide variety of psycholegal roles and functions.\n\nFor example, as researchers, forensic practitioners may participate in the collection and dissemination of data that are relevant to various legal issues.\n\n\nAs advisors, forensic practitioners may provide an attorney with an informed understanding of the role that psychology can play in the case at hand.\n\n\nAs consultants, forensic practitioners may explain the practical implications of relevant research, examination findings, and the opinions of other psycholegal experts.\n\n\nAs examiners, forensic practitioners may assess an individual’s functioning and report findings and opinions to the attorney, a legal tribunal, an employer, an insurer, or others (American Psychological Association, 2010; American Psychological Association, 2011a).\n\n\nAs treatment providers, forensic practitioners may provide therapeutic services tailored to the issues and context of a legal proceeding.\n\n\nAs mediators or negotiators, forensic practitioners may serve in a third-party neutral role and assist parties in resolving disputes.\n\n\nAs arbiters, special masters, or case managers with decision-making authority, forensic practitioners may serve parties, attorneys, and the courts (American Psychological Association, 2011b).\n\nThese guidelines are informed by the American Psychological Association’s (APA’s) Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct (hereinafter referred to as the EPPCC; APA, 2002). The term guidelines refers to statements that suggest or recommend speciﬁc professional behavior, endeavors, or conduct for psychologists. Guidelines differ from standards in that standards are mandatory and may be accompanied by an enforcement mechanism. Guidelines are aspiration in intent. They are intended to facilitate the continued systematic development of the profession and facilitate a high level of practice by psychologists. Guidelines are not intended to be mandatory or exhaustive and may not be applicable to every professional situation. They are not deﬁnitive, and they are not intended to take precedence over the judgment of psychologists.\nAs such, the Guidelines are advisory in areas in which the forensic practitioner has discretion to exercise professional judgment that is not prohibited or mandated by the EPPCC or applicable law, rules, or regulations. The Guidelines neither add obligations to nor eliminate obligations from the EPPCC, but provide additional guidance for psychologists. The modifiers used in the Guidelines (e.g., reasonably, appropriate, potentially) are included in recognition of the need for professional judgment on the part of forensic practitioners; ensure applicability across the broad range of activities conducted by forensic practitioners; and reduce the likelihood of enacting an inflexible set of guidelines that might be inapplicable as forensic practice evolves. The use of these modifiers, and the recognition of the role of professional discretion and judgment, also reflects that forensic practitioners are likely to encounter facts and circumstances not anticipated by the Guidelines and they may have to act upon uncertain or incomplete evidence. The Guidelines may provide general or conceptual guidance in such circumstances. The Guidelines do not, however, exhaust the legal, professional, moral and ethical considerations that inform forensic practitioners, for no complex activity can be completely defined by legal rules, codes of conduct, and aspirational guidelines.\nThe Guidelines are not intended to serve as a basis for disciplinary action or civil or criminal liability. The standard of care is established by a competent authority not by the Guidelines. No ethical, licensure, or other administrative action or remedy, nor any other cause of action, should be taken solely on the basis of a forensic practitioner acting in a manner consistent or inconsistent with these Guidelines.\nIn cases in which a competent authority references the Guidelines when formulating standards, the authority should consider that the Guidelines attempt to identify a high level of quality in forensic practice. Competent practice is defined as the conduct of a reasonably prudent forensic practitioner engaged in similar activities in similar circumstances. Professional conduct evolves and may be viewed along a continuum of adequacy, and “minimally competent” and “best possible” are usually different points along that continuum.\nThe Guidelines are designed to be national in scope and are intended to be consistent with state and federal law. In cases in which a conflict between legal and professional obligations occur, forensic practitioners make known their commitment to the EPPCC and the Guidelines and take steps to achieve an appropriate resolution consistent with the EPPCC and Guidelines.\nThe format of the Guidelines is different from most other practice guidelines developed under the auspices of APA. This reflects the history of the Guidelines as well as the fact that the Guidelines are considerably broader in scope than any other APA-developed guidelines. Indeed, these are the only APA-approved guidelines that address a complete specialty practice area. Despite this difference in format, the Guidelines function as all other APA guideline documents.\nThis  document  replaces the 1991 Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists which were approved by the American Psychology-Law Society, Division 41 of the American Psychological Association and the American Board of Forensic Psychology. The current revision has also been approved by the Council of Representatives of the American Psychological Association. Appendix I includes a discussion of the revision process, enactment, and current status of these Guidelines. Appendix II includes definitions and terminology as used for the purposes of these Guidelines."

    "text": "10.01 Focus on Legally Relevant Factors\nForensic examiners seek to assist the trier of fact to understand evidence or determine a fact in issue, and they provide information that is most relevant to the psycholegal issue. In reports and testimony forensic practitioners typically provide information about examinees’ functional abilities, capacities, knowledge, and beliefs, and address their opinions and recommendations to the identified psycholegal issues (American Bar Association and American Psychological Assocation, 2008; Grisso, 1986, 2003; Heilbrun, Marczyk, DeMatteo, & Mack-Allen, 2007).\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to consider the problems that may arise by using a clinical diagnosis in some forensic contexts, and consider and qualify their opinions and testimony appropriately.\n\n\n10.02 Selection and Use of Assessment Procedures\nForensic practitioners use assessment procedures in the manner and for the purposes that are appropriate in light of the research on or evidence of their usefulness and proper application (EPPCC Standard 9.02, American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, in press9). This includes assessment techniques, interviews, tests, instruments, and other procedures and their administration, adaptation, scoring, and interpretation, including computerized scoring and interpretation systems.\nForensic practitioners use assessment instruments whose validity and reliability have been established for use with members of the population assessed. When such validity and reliability have not been established, forensic practitioners consider and describe the strengths and limitations of their findings. Forensic practitioners use assessment methods that are appropriate to an examinee’s language preference and competence, unless the use of an alternative language is relevant to the assessment issues (EPPCC Standard 9.02).\nAssessment in forensic contexts differs from assessment in therapeutic contexts in important ways that forensic practitioners strive to take into account when conducting forensic examinations. Forensic practitioners seek to consider the strengths and limitations of employing traditional assessment procedures in forensic examinations (American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, in press). Given the stakes involved in forensic contexts, forensic practitioners strive to ensure the integrity and security of test materials and results (American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, in press9).\nWhen the validity of an assessment technique has not been established in the forensic context or setting in which it is being used, the forensic practitioner seeks to describe the strengths and limitations of any test results and explain the extrapolation of these data to the forensic context Because of the many differences between forensic and therapeutic contexts, forensic practitioners consider and seek to make known that some examination results may warrant substantially different interpretation when administered in forensic contexts (American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, in press).\nForensic practitioners consider and seek to make known that forensic examination results can be affected by factors unique to, or differentially present in, forensic contexts including response style, voluntariness of participation, and situational stress associated with involvement in forensic or legal matters (American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, in press).\n\n\n10.03 Appreciation of Individual Differences\nWhen interpreting assessment results forensic practitioners consider the purpose of the assessment as well as the various test factors, test-taking abilities, and other characteristics of the person being assessed, such as situational, personal, linguistic, and cultural differences that might affect their judgments or reduce the accuracy of their interpretations (EPPCC Standard 9.06). Forensic practitioners strive to identify any significant strengths and limitations of their procedures and interpretations.\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to consider how the assessment process may be impacted by any disability an examinee is experiencing, make accommodations as possible, and consider such when interpreting and communicating the results of the assessment (American Psychological Association Task Force on Guidelines for Assessment and treatment of Persons with Disabilities, 2011).\n\n\n10.04 Consideration of Assessment Settings\nIn order to maximize the validity of assessment results, forensic practitioners strive to conduct evaluations in settings that provide adequate comfort, safety and privacy.\n\n\n10.05 Provision of Assessment Feedback\nForensic practitioners take reasonable steps to explain assessment results to the examinee or a designated representative in language they can understand (EPPCC Standard 9.10). In those circumstances in which communication about assessment results is precluded, the forensic practitioner explains this to the examinee in advance (EPPCC Standard 9.10).\nForensic practitioners seek to provide information about professional work in a manner consistent with professional and legal standards for the disclosure of test data or results, interpretation of data, and the factual bases for conclusions.\n\n\n10.06 Documentation and Compilation of Data Considered\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to recognize the importance of documenting all data they consider with enough detail and quality to allow for reasonable judicial scrutiny and adequate discovery by all parties. This documentation includes, but is not limited to, letters and consultations; notes, recordings, and transcriptions; assessment and test data, scoring reports and interpretations; and all other records in any form or medium that were created or exchanged in connection with a matter.\nWhen contemplating third party observation or audio/video-recording of examinations forensic practitioners strive to consider any law that may control such matters, the need for transparency and documentation, and the potential impact of observation or recording on the validity of the examination and test security (American Psychological Association Committee on Psychological Tests and Assessment, 2007).\n\n\n10.07 Provision of Documentation\nPursuant to proper subpoenas or court orders, or other legally proper consent from authorized persons, forensic practitioners seek to make available all documentation described in 10.05, all financial records related to the matter, and any other records including reports (and draft reports if they have been provided to a party, attorney, or other entity for review), that might reasonably be related to the opinions to be expressed.\n\n\n10.08 Recordkeeping\nForensic practitioners establish and maintain a system of recordkeeping and professional communication (EPPCC Standard 6.01; American Psychological Association, 2007), and attend to relevant laws and rules. When indicated by the extent of the rights, liberties, and properties that may be at risk, the complexity of the case, the amount and legal significance of unique evidence in the care and control of the forensic practitioner, and the likelihood of future appeal, forensic practitioners strive to inform the retaining party of the limits of recordkeeping times. If requested to do so, forensic practitioners consider maintaining such records until notified that all appeals in the matter have been exhausted, or sending a copy of any unique components/aspects of the record in their care and control to the retaining party before destruction of the record."

    "text": "Forensic practitioners recognize their ethical obligations to maintain the confidentiality of information relating to a client or retaining party, except insofar as disclosure is consented to by the client or retaining party, or required or permitted by law (EPPCC Standard 4.01).\n\n\n8.01 Release of Information\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to recognize the importance of complying with properly noticed and served subpoenas or court orders directing release of information, or other legally proper consent from duly authorized persons, unless there is a legally valid reason to offer an objection. When in doubt about an appropriate response or course of action, forensic practitioners may seek assistance from the retaining client, retain and seek legal advice from their own attorney, or formally notify the drafter of the subpoena or order of their uncertainty.\n\n\n8.02 Access to Information\nIf requested, forensic practitioners seek to provide the retaining party access to, and a meaningful explanation of, all information that is in their records for the matter at hand, consistent with the relevant law, applicable codes of ethics and professional standards, and institutional rules and regulations. Forensic examinees typically are not provided access to the forensic practitioner’s records without the consent of the retaining party. Access to records by anyone other than the retaining party is governed by legal process, usually subpoena or court order, or by explicit consent of the retaining party. Forensic practitioners may charge a reasonable fee for the costs associated with the storage, reproduction, review, and provision of records.\n\n\n8.03 Acquiring Collateral and Third Party Information\nForensic practitioners strive to access information or records from collateral sources with the consent of the relevant attorney or the relevant party, or when otherwise authorized by law or court order.\n\n\n8.04 Use of Case Materials in Teaching, Continuing Education, and Other Scholarly Activities\nForensic practitioners using case materials for purposes of teaching, training, or research strive to present such information in a fair, balanced, and respectful manner. They attempt to protect the privacy of persons by disguising the confidential, personally identifiable information of all persons and entities who would reasonably claim a privacy interest; using only those aspects of the case available in the public domain; or obtaining consent from the relevant clients, parties, participants, and organizations to use the materials for such purposes (EPPCC Standard 4.07; also see Sections 11.06 and 11.07 of these guidelines)."

    "text": "In forensic psychology practice conflicting responsibilities and demands may be encountered. When conflicts occur, forensic practitioners seek to make the conflict known to the relevant parties or agencies, and consider the rights and interests of the relevant parties or agencies in their attempts to resolve the conflict.\n\n\n7.01 Conflicts with Legal Authority\nWhen their responsibilities conflict with law, regulations, or other governing legal authority, forensic practitioners make known their commitment to the EPPCC, and take steps to resolve the conflict. In situations in which the EPPCC or Guidelines are in conflict with the law, attempts to resolve the conflict are made in accordance with the EPPCC (EPPCC Standard 1.02).\nWhen the conflict cannot be resolved by such means, forensic practitioners may adhere to the requirements of the law, regulations, or other governing legal authority, but only to the extent required and not in any way that violates a person’s human rights (EPPCC Standard 1.03).\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to consider the appropriateness of complying with court orders when such compliance creates potential conflicts with professional standards of practice.\n\n\n7.02 Conflicts with Organizational Demands\nWhen the demands of an organization with which they are affiliated or for whom they are working conflict with their professional responsibilities and obligations, forensic practitioners strive to clarify the nature of the conflict and, to the extent feasible, resolve the conflict in a way consistent with professional obligations and responsibilities (EPPCC Standard 1.03).\n\n\n7.03 Resolving Ethical Issues with Fellow Professionals\nWhen an apparent or potential ethical violation has caused, or is likely to cause, substantial harm, forensic practitioners are encouraged to take action appropriate to the situation and consider a number of factors including the nature and the immediacy of the potential harm; applicable privacy, confidentiality, and privilege; how the rights of the relevant parties may be affected by a particular course of action; and any other legal or ethical obligations (EPPCC Standard 1.04). Steps to resolve perceived ethical conflicts may include, but are not be limited to, obtaining the consultation of knowledgeable colleagues, obtaining the advice of independent counsel, and conferring directly with the client.\nWhen forensic practitioners believe there may have been an ethical violation by another professional, an attempt is made to resolve the issue by bringing it to the attention of that individual, if that attempt does not violate any rights or privileges that may be involved, and if an informal resolution appears appropriate (EPPCC Standard 1.04). If this does not result in a satisfactory resolution, the forensic practitioner may have to take further action appropriate to the situation, including making a report to third parties of the perceived ethical violation (EPPCC Standard 1.05). In most instances, in order to minimize unforeseen risks to the party’s rights in the legal matter, forensic practitioners consider consulting with the client before attempting to resolve a perceived ethical violation with another professional."

    "title": "Relationship",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Whether a forensic practitioner-client relationship exists depends on the circumstances and is determined by a number of factors which may include the information exchanged between the potential client and the forensic practitioner prior to, or at the initiation of, any contact or service, the nature of the interaction, and the purpose of the interaction.\nIn their work, forensic practitioners recognize that relationships are established with those who retain their services (e.g., retaining parties, employers, insurers, the court) and those with whom they interact (e.g., examinees, collateral contacts, research participants, students). Forensic practitioners recognize that associated obligations and duties vary as a function of the nature of the relationship.\n4.01 Responsibilities to Retaining Parties Most responsibilities to the retaining party attach only after the retaining party has requested and the forensic practitioner has agreed to render professional services and an agreement regarding compensation has been reached. Forensic practitioners are aware that there are some responsibilities, such as privacy, confidentiality, and privilege that may attach when the forensic practitioner agrees to consider whether a forensic practitioner-retaining party relationship shall be established. Forensic practitioners, prior to entering into a contract, may direct the potential retaining party not to reveal any confidential or privileged information as a way of protecting the retaining party’s interest in case a conflict exists as a result of pre-existing relationships.\nAt the initiation of any request for service, forensic practitioners seek to clarify the nature of the relationship and the services to be provided including the role of the forensic practitioner (e.g., trial consultant, forensic examiner, treatment provider, expert witness, research consultant); which person or entity is the client; the probable uses of the services provided or information obtained; and any limitations to privacy, confidentiality, or privilege.\n4.02 Multiple Relationships A multiple relationship occurs when a forensic practitioner is in a professional role with a person and, at the same time or at a subsequent time, is in a different role with the same person; is involved in a personal, fiscal, or other relationship with an adverse party; at the same time is in a relationship with a person closely associated with or related to the person with whom the forensic practitioner has the professional relationship; or offers or agrees to enter into another relationship in the future with the person or a person closely associated with or related to the person (EPPCC Standard 3.05).\nForensic practitioners strive to recognize the potential conflicts of interest and threats to objectivity inherent in multiple relationships. Forensic practitioners are encouraged to recognize that some personal and professional relationships may interfere with their ability to practice in a competent and impartial manner and they seek to minimize any detrimental effects by avoiding involvement in such matters whenever feasible or limiting their assistance in a manner that is consistent with professional obligations.\n4.02.01 Therapeutic-Forensic Role Conflicts Providing forensic and therapeutic psychological services to the same individual or closely related individuals involves multiple relationships that may impair objectivity and/or cause exploitation or other harm. Therefore, when requested or ordered to provide either concurrent or sequential forensic and therapeutic services, forensic practitioners are encouraged to disclose the potential risk and make reasonable efforts to refer the request to another qualified provider. If referral is not possible, the forensic practitioner is encouraged to consider the risks and benefits to all parties and to the legal system or entity likely to be impacted, the possibility of separating each service widely in time, seeking judicial review and direction, and consulting with knowledgeable colleagues. When providing both forensic and therapeutic services, forensic practitioners seek to minimize the potential negative effects of this circumstance (EPPCC Standard 3.05).\n4.02.02 Expert Testimony by Practitioners Providing Therapeutic Services Providing expert testimony about a patient who is a participant in a legal matter does not necessarily involve the practice of forensic psychology even when that testimony is relevant to a psycholegal issue before the decision-maker. For example, providing testimony on matters such as a patient’s reported history or other statements, mental status, diagnosis, progress, prognosis, and treatment would not ordinarily be considered forensic practice even when the testimony is related to a psycholegal issue before the decision-maker. In contrast, rendering opinions and providing testimony about a person on psycholegal issues (e.g., criminal responsibility, legal causation, proximate cause, trial competence, testamentary capacity, the relative merits of parenting arrangements) would ordinarily be considered the practice of forensic psychology.\nConsistent with their ethical obligations to base their opinions on information and techniques sufficient to substantiate their findings (EPPCC Standards 2.04, 9.01), forensic practitioners are encouraged to provide testimony only on those issues for which they have adequate foundation and only when a reasonable forensic practitioner engaged in similar circumstances would determine that the ability to make a proper decision is unlikely to be impaired. As with testimony regarding forensic examinees, the forensic practitioner strives to identify any substantive limitations that may affect the reliability and validity of the facts or opinions offered, and communicates these to the decision maker.\n4.02.03 Provision of Forensic Therapeutic Services Although some therapeutic services can be considered forensic in nature, the fact that therapeutic services are ordered by the court does not necessarily make them forensic.\nIn determining whether a therapeutic service should be considered the practice of forensic psychology, psychologists are encouraged to consider the potential impact of the legal context on treatment, the potential for treatment to impact the psycholegal issues involved in the case, and whether another reasonable psychologist in a similar position would consider the service to be forensic and these Guidelines to be applicable.\nTherapeutic services can have significant effects on current or future legal proceedings. Forensic practitioners are encouraged to consider these effects and minimize any unintended or negative effects on such proceedings or therapy when they provide therapeutic services in forensic contexts.\n4.03 Provision of Emergency Mental Health Services to Forensic Examinees When providing forensic examination services an emergency may arise that requires the practitioner to provide short term therapeutic services to the examinee in order to prevent imminent harm to the examinee or others. In such cases, the forensic practitioner is encouraged to limit disclosure of information and inform the retaining attorney, legal representative, or the court in an appropriate manner. Upon providing emergency treatment to examinees, forensic practitioners consider whether they can continue in a forensic role with that individual so that potential for harm to the recipient of services is avoided (EPPCC 3.04)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Because substantial rights, liberties, and properties are often at risk in forensic matters, and because the methods and procedures of forensic practitioners are complex and may not be accurately anticipated by the recipients of forensic services, forensic practitioners strive to inform service recipients about the nature and parameters of the services to be provided (EPPCC Standards 3.04, 3.10).\n\n\n6.01 Timing and Substance\nForensic practitioners strive to inform clients, examinees, and others who are the recipients of forensic services as soon as is feasible about the nature and extent of reasonably anticipated forensic services.\nIn determining what information to impart, forensic practitioners are encouraged to consider a variety of factors including the person’s experience or training in psychological and legal matters of the type involved and whether the person is represented by counsel. When questions or uncertainties remain after they have made the effort to explain the necessary information, forensic practitioners may recommend that the person seek legal advice.\n\n\n6.02 Communication with Those Seeking to Retain a Forensic Practitioner\nAs part of the initial process of being retained, or as soon thereafter as previously unknown information becomes available, forensic practitioners strive to disclose to the retaining party information that would reasonably be anticipated to affect a decision to retain or continue the services of the forensic practitioner.\nThis disclosure may include, but is not limited to, the fee structure for anticipated services; prior and current personal or professional activities, obligations and relationships that would reasonably lead to the fact or the appearance of a conflict of interest; the forensic practitioner’s knowledge, skill, experience, and education relevant to the forensic services being considered, including any significant limitations; and the scientific bases and limitations of the methods and procedures which are expected to be employed.\n\n\n6.03 Communication with Forensic Examinees\nForensic practitioners inform examinees about the nature and purpose of the examination (EPPCC Standard 9.03; American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, 1999). Such information may include the purpose, nature, and anticipated use of the examination; who will have access to the information; associated limitations on privacy, confidentiality, and privilege including who is authorized to release or access the information contained in the forensic practitioner’s records; the voluntary or involuntary nature of participation, including potential consequences of participation or non-participation, if known; and, if the cost of the service is the responsibility of the examinee, the anticipated cost.\n\n\n6.03.01 Persons Not Ordered or Mandated to Undergo Examination\nIf the examinee is not ordered by the court to participate in a forensic examination, the forensic practitioner seeks his or her informed consent (EPPCC Standards 3.10, 9.03). If the examinee declines to proceed after being notified of the nature and purpose of the forensic examination, the forensic practitioner may consider postponing the examination, advising the examinee to contact his or her attorney, and notifying the retaining party about the examinee’s unwillingness to proceed.\n\n\n6.03.02 Persons Ordered or Mandated to Undergo Examination or Treatment\nIf the examinee is ordered by the court to participate, the forensic practitioner can conduct the examination over the objection, and without the consent, of the examinee (EPPCC Standards 3.10, 9.03). If the examinee declines to proceed after being notified of the nature and purpose of the forensic examination, the forensic practitioner may consider a variety of options including postponing the examination, advising the examinee to contact his or her attorney, and notifying the retaining party about the examinee’s unwillingness to proceed.\nWhen an individual is ordered to undergo treatment but the goals of treatment are determined by a legal authority rather than the individual receiving services, the forensic practitioner informs the service recipient of the nature and purpose of treatment, and any limitations on confidentiality and privilege (EPPCC Standards 3.10, 10.01).\n\n\n6.03.03 Persons Lacking Capacity to Provide Informed Consent\nForensic practitioners appreciate that the very conditions that precipitate psychological examination of individuals involved in legal proceedings can impair their functioning in a variety of important ways, including their ability to understand and consent to the evaluation process.\nFor examinees adjudicated or presumed by law to lack the capacity to provide informed consent for the anticipated forensic service, the forensic practitioner nevertheless provides an appropriate explanation, seeks the examinee’s assent, and obtain appropriate permission from a legally authorized person, as permitted or required by law (EPPCC Standards 3.10, 9.03).\nFor examinees whom the forensic practitioner has concluded lack capacity to provide informed consent to a proposed, non-court-ordered service, but who have not been adjudicated as lacking such capacity, the forensic practitioner strives to take reasonable steps to protect their rights and welfare (EPPCC Standard 3.10). In such cases, the forensic practitioner may consider suspending the proposed service or notifying the examinee’s attorney or the retaining party.\n\n\n6.03.04 Evaluation of Persons Not Represented by Counsel\nBecause of the significant rights that may be at issue in a legal proceeding, forensic practitioners carefully consider the appropriateness of conducting a forensic evaluation of an individual who is not represented by counsel. Forensic practitioners may consider conducting such evaluations or delaying the evaluation so as to provide the examinee with the opportunity to consult with counsel.\n\n\n6.04 Communication with Collateral Sources of Information\nForensic practitioners disclose to potential collateral sources information that might reasonably be expected to inform their decisions about participating that may include, but may not be limited to, who has retained the forensic practitioner; the nature, purpose, and intended use of the examination or other procedure; the nature of and any limits on privacy, confidentiality, and privilege; and whether their participation is voluntary (EPPCC Standard 3.10).\n\n\n6.05 Communication in Research Contexts\nWhen engaging in research or scholarly activities conducted as a service to a client in a legal proceeding, forensic practitioners attempt to clarify any anticipated use of the research or scholarly product, disclose their role in the resulting research or scholarly products, and obtain whatever consent or agreement is required.\nIn advance of any scientific study, forensic practitioners seek to negotiate with the client the circumstances under and manner in which the results may be made known to others. Forensic practitioners strive to balance the potentially competing rights and interests of the retaining party with the inappropriateness of suppressing data, for example, by agreeing to report the data without identifying the jurisdiction in which the study took place. Forensic practitioners represent the results of research in an accurate manner (EPPCC Standard 5.01)."

Did you think of My Cousin Vinny or Law & Order: SVU? Chances are you imagined a dramatic moment where the lawyer asks the one question that blows the case wide open. But what if jurors could ask questions as well? \n \nDespite being an experienced trial attorney in both federal and state court with a master’s degree in legal and forensic psychology, it was not until last summer during a two-week trial in Dallas County that I experienced this practice first-hand. This trial was an opportunity for me to expand my jury science specialty, specifically in regard to the practice of jurors asking questions—through the judge—during trial. While juror questioning varies greatly depending on the courtroom due to judicial discretion, but, generally, judges who allow the practice ask jury members to write any outstanding questions they have for a witness at the end of the attorney-led examination and any questions not objected to by attorneys are then asked of the witness by the judge. This practice balances juror anonymity and neutrality while also leading to an overall increased level of engagement and dedication of the jury.   \n \nThis article discusses the historical context of juror questioning, as well as the benefits, concerns, and the practical implications for civil cases. At bottom, the practice of jurors asking questions does not appear to be subsiding. In fact, it continues to grow—judges, lawyers, witnesses, and prospective jurors should all be aware of what this looks like for the future.  \n  \n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n  \n\n    \n    \n      Read the Full Article\n    \n  \n\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n  \n    \n      \n        \n           \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n  Call for Co-Chairs for 2024 AP-LS Conference\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n  \n    The AP-LS Conference Advisory Committee (CAC) is seeking two interested professionals to co-chair the March 2024 Annual Conference in Los Angeles.

Long-standing issues such as prison over-crowding, limited financial resources, geographical remoteness, low staff recruitment and retention, safety and  security constraints, and traditional administrative values that favor punishment over rehabilitation can stifle the implementation of more innovative and progressive efforts. However, the onset of the  COVID-19 pandemic and increasing calls from advocacy groups, politicians, and the general public have placed pressures on correctional systems to explore alternative solutions that balance crime reduction with humane care and commonsense policies. As jails and prisons continue to serve as major mental health providers, innovations specific to psychological interventions are especially relevant. \n \nThis special section will highlight emerging issues and inventive trends in correctional psychology research and practice that can inform policy decisions and reform efforts. Original quantitative and/or qualitative research is strongly encouraged; however, empirically grounded systematic reviews or policy/practice recommendations will also be considered. Manuscripts focused on all areas of corrections are welcome, but topics of particular interest include: \n\nTechnological advances that improve access to and delivery of correctional practices or policy implementation\nIntegrating social justice principles in assessment and intervention for clients in correctional settings\nMental and behavioral health responses to COVID-19 in correctional settings\nCreative approaches to addressing and reducing the jail-based competency crisis\nValidation of novel and feasible suicide and violence risk instruments with correctional  samples\nMedication assisted treatment and other innovative substance use interventions\nAdaptation or development of evidence-based assessment or interventions for underserved and understudied populations (e.g., people with neurodevelopmental disorders, women and non-binary people, LGBTQIA+ persons, people of color, etc.)\nUnique methodological or statistical approaches to conducting correctional research or evaluating the effectiveness of new policies  \n\nFor general inquiries, prospective contributors may contact Dr. Ashley Batastini  (Ashley.batastini@memphis.edu).\n \nManuscripts must be submitted through the journal’s online submission portal in accordance with specified formatting guidelines. Once in the portal, there will  be a drop-down option to designate your submission for consideration in this special section.

Besides the traditional format comprising a series of exceptional keynotes, workshops, open papers/symposia, and poster sessions, we aim to boost the interactivity and networking opportunities offered by the EAPL, while introducing new presentation types (blitz talks, expert focus sessions, and keynote outstanding questions).\nImportant dates\n \nSubmission deadline: April 24, 2023\nNotifications of acceptance will be offered on a rolling basis until May 15, 2023, at the latest.\nMain Themes\n\nEyewitness identification & memory\nInterviews, interrogations & confessions\nDeception detection & malingering\nCredibility assessment\nForensic & risk assessment\nDecision-making\nCriminal investigations\nVictims & offenders\n\nTypes of Submissions\n \nOral Presentation\nOral presentation sessions provide the opportunity for an extended presentation of your research, followed by a discussion with participants within dedicated parallel sessions which will be grouped by the organizers.\n \nPoster Presentation\nThe poster session will be a unique opportunity for an extended discussion of your research, potentially with all conference participants.\n \nBlitz-Talk\nBlitz-Talks are concise individual contributions. Each presenter will have five minutes to present and two minutes for questions. Blitz-Talks can report all types of research, but this submission type is especially suitable for presenting single studies on novel topics, new data for discussion, replication studies, null findings, and multi-study papers using a well-known methodology.\n \nSymposium\nTo encourage interaction between EAPL members on specific common topics of interest, we are welcoming oral symposia. A symposium chair (or two co-chairs) invites three to five colleagues, ideally belonging to different research groups to participate.\nFor more details regarding submissions, visit the website.

And bring your ideas to the EC if you have thoughts about how our division can further represent what we are doing to APA and/or engage in new opportunities with other divisions.\n \n  \n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n  \n    \n      \n        \n           \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n  The AP-LS Teaching, Training, and Careers (TTC) Committee Recognizes Dr. Angela Evans and Dr. Ashley Batastini Through the Outstanding Teaching and Mentoring in the Field of Psychology and Law Awards\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n  \n    Each year, AP-LS and the TTC Committee recognize excellence in teaching and mentorship in the field demonstrated by two of our members.

We publish authored and edited volumes on current issues at the intersection of psychology and law. Books are typically a state of the science synthesis of a body of existing research with implications for practice and/or policy. Authors and editors should have a substantial and recent track record of publication and/or practice in psychology or law, and at least one should hold a doctorate in psychology or closely related behavioral science. If you have a proposal for a new book in the series or you would simply like more information, reach out to a member of the editorial team. We would be happy to tell you more.    \n \nThe editorial board members are:\nMonica Miller, Division 41 Book Series Editor (mkmiller@unr.edu)Monique Bowen, Division 41 Book Series Associate Editor (mbowen2@antioch.edu)Jemour Maddux, Division 41 Book Series Associate Editor (jm@rule702.com) \n  \n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n  On the Job or Postdoc Market?

Although there was a decline in the number of votes cast by APA members for Division 41 in the 2024 apportionment process, we did maintain our two Council of Representative seats. To maintain these two Division 41 seats on Council, it will be important for those APLS members who are also APA members to cast more of their votes for Division 41 in the next apportionment vote.\n \nOutcome of Voting on Amendments to APA Bylaws\nAll three of the most recently proposed amendments to the APA bylaws were approved by the membership (proportion of voting members approving in parentheses below).\n \n\nAmendment #1 – Update Mission of Membership Board to be in Alignment with Current Practices  (84.05%)\nAmendment #2 – Association Members Gain Voting Privileges After One Year Instead of Five Years (73.33%)\nAmendment #3 – Add a Graduate Student member on the Board for the Advancement of Psychology in the Public Interest, Board of Convention Affairs, Board of Educational Affairs, Board of Professional Affairs, Board of Scientific Affairs, Membership Board and Policy and Planning Board (82.28%)\n\n \nLeadership Opportunities & Fellowships\nAPA seeks nominations (including self-nominations) for its many boards and committees. We strongly encourage you to review the openings and nomination instructions. This is a great way to gain leadership experience and to get the voice of AP-LS heard within APA governance. You need to be an APA member to serve on an APA board or committee. Nominations are due January 31. Election slates are then developed and the APA Board of Directors approves the slates by mid-April. APA Council members then vote in Fall 2023. Additional questions can be directed to the APA Election Office at elections@apa.org. \n \nAPA also seeks nominees for the APA Congressional Fellowship program and APA Executive Branch Science Fellowship. Applications are due January 30. \n \nStandards of Accreditation for Master's Degree Programs\nAPA seeks public comments on Implementing Regulations related to the Standards of Accreditation for Health Service Psychology, Master’s Degree Programs, which outline education and training requirements for the accreditation of health service psychology programs at the master’s level. Information about the proposed standards and public comment is available on their website.

Practitioners are in a unique position to offer education, assessment, intervention and advocacy on issues of REC disparities, racism, and discrimination in the field of psychology and the law. However, a limited body of research, lack of practice guidelines on REC integration in forensic practice, and low representation of Black, Indigenous, People Of Color (BIPOC) professionals, limit such efforts. Mentorship of emerging practitioners in psychology and the law on such issues can bridge the gap of knowledge, application, and BIPOC representation in the field.  \n \nThe AP-LS Practice Committee wants to recognize the substantive contributions of practitioner mentors who educate and support emerging clinicians in psychology and the law with a lens toward the elimination of REC disparities and social justice. For these purposes, we use Goldstein’s (2007) definition of the practice of psychology and the law: “The application of psychological research, theory, practice, and traditional and specialized methodology (e.g.  interviewing, psychological testing, forensic assessment, and forensically relevant instruments) to provide information relevant to a legal question.”  \n \nThe award for Outstanding Practitioner Mentoring to Eliminate Racial, Ethnic and Cultural (REC) Disparities in the Field of Psychology and the Law, will be conferred on a yearly basis. The Recipient will receive a $500.00 cash award, a plaque to be presented at the annual AP-LS conference and will be featured in an AP-LS newsletter article, written by the practice committee, highlighting the recipient’s achievements and recommendations to other practitioners. Highlighting the recipient's mentorship practices and experiences can serve as a model for other professionals in the field of psychology and the law.  \nNomination packages are due January 15, 2023 and should be emailed to the chair of the award subcommittee, Dr. Lara Guzmán-Hosta at lguzman.hosta@gmail.com.\n \n  \n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n  \n\n    \n    \n      Read More\n    \n  \n\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n  \n    \n      \n        \n           \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n  BRIDGE Committee Award ProgramsCall for Applications 2023\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n  \n    The AP-LS Broadening Representation Inclusion, Diversity, and Global Equity or BRIDGE Committee is seeking applicants for two award programs. As part of the BRIDGE Committee initiative to increase diversity within AP-LS, and the profession as a whole, these award programs support research for undergraduate and graduate students. Please take a few minutes to review the program descriptions below and consider if you or any students you know might be eligible, and encourage them to apply. Also, please feel free to forward this information to any colleagues who might be interested in these award programs. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15, 2022 through January 15, 2023. Recipients will be announced in February 2023.\n  \n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n  \n\n    \n    \n      Submit Award Applications\n    \n  \n\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n  \n    \n      \n        \n           \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n  Access Path to Psychology and Law Experience Program\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n  \n    The purpose of the Access Path to Psychology and Law Experience (AP) Program is to increase diversity within psychology and law by increasing the pipeline of competitive graduate school applicants from groups that currently are underrepresented in the field, including racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and disabled students. AP is designed to encourage faculty members to recruit students from underrepresented groups into their research labs. It provides financial support for the students to obtain meaningful research experience and attend the AP-LS conference as well as other opportunities for mentoring and development. It is the intention of the BRIDGE Committee that many of the students in the AP program will apply for graduate training related to psychology and law and ultimately become professionals in the field. The AP program primarily targets undergraduate students, but students from terminal master’s degree programs will also be considered. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15, 2022 through January 15, 2023. Recipients will be announced in February 2023.\nFor more information about the AP Program, please contact the program Chair, Dr. Jason Lawrence at jason.lawrence@dmh.mo.gov.\n  \n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n  \n\n    \n    \n      Submit Award Applications\n    \n  \n\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n  \n    \n      \n        \n           \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n  AP-LS Diversity in Psychology and Law Research Awards\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n  \n    The purpose of the Diversity in Psychology and Law Research Awards is to promote diversity within the American Psychology-Law Society by supporting student research on psycholegal issues related to diversity as well as research by students from underrepresented groups. Projects are eligible for consideration for this award if (1) they investigate topics related to psychology, law, diversity, and/or multiculturalism (e.g., research pertaining to psycholegal issues on race, gender, culture, sexual orientation, etc.) or (2) if the principal investigator is a member of an underrepresented group, including racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and students with disabilities. Consistent with the mission of the BRIDGE Committee, these awards are intended to facilitate the research of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in AP-LS, as well as research about issues of potential interest and importance to such groups. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15, 2022 through January 15, 2023.

So let’s start with the basics: our association is stronger than ever. We have an incredibly active membership at every level of training – from undergraduates to well-established professionals. Our journals (both our official journal, LHB, and our unofficial second journal, PPPL) have never been more impactful. Our upcoming conference has an impressive set of plenary presentations, symposia, and most importantly, ample opportunities for connecting. And the early numbers on conference registration point to a very strong turnout. In other words, AP-LS is running smoothly. Admittedly, we’ve been having some adjustment challenges to the loss of our long-time administrator (Kathy Gaskey) and the switch to a professional management company, but those adjustments are being worked out, and shouldn’t be noticeable to the vast majority of members. And when the dust settles on this transition, we’ll be stronger and better organized than ever. Which brings me to the question of what sort of “presidential initiative” I should be working on.\nMy predecessors have developed and carried out many impressive and thoughtful initiatives, such as efforts to increase the diversity of our membership (e.g., through developing and nurturing our impressive BRIDGE Committee and the many activities they sponsor), increasing the representation of attorneys in our membership (i.e., growing the L in AP-LS), impacting the communities we visit, and expanding the “inner circle” of the organization leadership by bringing in new faces to serve on committees and task forces. There have also been many efforts behind the scenes that have not necessarily stemmed from any specific Presidential Initiatives. Nonetheless, in recent years we’ve taken many steps to increase the resources we make available to both students and members (e.g., increasing our funding for student support grants, developing the ECP and REID grants), ease the transition from student to early career professional, make conference attendance more accessible for new parents and those with physical impediments, and to expand the services (and attention) we provide for our many members who work in applied settings. The latter development has become increasingly important, and one that is personally important to me as someone who divides their time (and interests) between academia and applied practice. One visible example of this increased attention to practitioners is the addition of CE credits for a large portion of the conference programming – included in the cost of registration (not just for pre-conference workshops, which we have always offered and continue to provide this year). For a number of logistical reasons we can’t provide CE credits for every paper presentation, but we are providing CE credits for virtually all symposia, invited addresses and plenary sessions so attendees should be able to get as many as 15 CE credits over the 2.5 conference days simply by attending talks that they may have attended anyway. Why are we doing this? To encourage our applied members to attend the annual meeting and keep their connection with the organization, and to see that the organization serves us all, not just the researchers who apply for the grants and get most of the awards. \nSo, what should our next steps be? I think the answer is growth. Not in membership numbers, though that might happen too, but in our scope and impact. In truth, this has been a personal mission of mine for most of my career, in part because many of my own interests haven’t always fit squarely into the mainstream topics that fill most of our journal pages and conference presentations. My early research focused on capacity to make treatment decisions and evolved into studying physician-assisted suicide. More recently, I’ve been involved in work surrounding immigration court, both in a clinical capacity (conducting asylum evaluations) and research (studying asylum-relevant issues in undocumented migrants). So not surprisingly, this is where I see the opportunities for growth in our association: bringing our skills as researchers and clinicians to legal issues that have traditionally garnered relatively little attention. Some examples? Immigration law is an easy starting point. How often are psychological evaluations used in asylum or deportation proceedings?  Are they helpful in increasing fairness of these proceedings, or impacting outcomes more generally (since “fairness” is an inherently challenging metric)? Are there better or worse approaches to conducting these types of evaluations? Is telephonic/video testimony (which has always been more common in Immigration court, even before the pandemic) less impactful? How do Immigration Court judges view expert testimony? These same questions could be applied to a range of other topics, including child custody evaluations, personal injury evaluations, and the capacity to make treatment or financial decisions (or guardianship more broadly). They are common legal issues that have a central role for psychology but are virtually absent from our journals and conferences, yet represent a large portion of the work that many forensic clinical psychologists engage in. And while these “clinical” examples are the ones that come first to mind (I am a clinician, after all), equally important novel and/or understudied questions exist for our non-clinical researchers. I’ll talk more about this in my Presidential Address, but in the meantime I would encourage you all – especially our younger members who are trying to carve out a niche for themselves in what might sometimes feel like a crowded field, to think about how you can expand your own personal range, whether that’s in research, consultation or clinical activities.\n \nSo there it is – a preview of my Presidential Initiative and a quick snapshot of our organization’s overall health. We’ve bounced back from the challenges of the pandemic and are at full strength. I hope to catch up with many of you at the annual meeting in Philadelphia next month, and for those of you I don’t know, please feel free to introduce yourself. I’m always happy to meet new people and make new friends. \nBarry Rosenfeld, Ph.D., A.B.P.P.

Batastini, Ph.D. \nUniversity of Memphis \n \nJennifer Eno Louden, Ph.D. \nThe University of Texas at El Paso \n \nVirginia Barber-Rioja, Ph.D. \nCorrectional Health Services/NYC Health + Hospitals \n \nCorrectional institutions and departments are often slow-moving regarding practice developments, policy reform, and research engagement. Long-standing issues such as prison over-crowding, limited financial resources, geographical remoteness, low staff recruitment and retention, safety and  security constraints, and traditional administrative values that favor punishment over rehabilitation can stifle the implementation of more innovative and progressive efforts.\n \nHowever, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing calls from advocacy groups, politicians, and the general public have placed pressures on correctional systems to explore alternative solutions that balance crime reduction with humane care and commonsense policies. As jails and prisons continue to serve as major mental health providers, innovations specific to psychological interventions are especially relevant. \n \nThis special section will highlight emerging issues and inventive trends in correctional psychology research and practice that can inform policy decisions and reform efforts. Original quantitative and/or qualitative research is strongly encouraged; however, empirically grounded systematic reviews or policy/practice recommendations will also be considered. Manuscripts focused on all areas of corrections are welcome, but topics of particular interest include: \n\nTechnological advances that improve access to and delivery of correctional practices or policy implementation\nIntegrating social justice principles in assessment and intervention for clients in correctional settings\nMental and behavioral health responses to COVID-19 in correctional settings\nCreative approaches to addressing and reducing the jail-based competency crisis\nValidation of novel and feasible suicide and violence risk instruments with correctional samples\nMedication-assisted treatment and other innovative substance use interventions\nAdaptation or development of evidence-based assessment or interventions for underserved and understudied populations (e.g., people with neurodevelopmental disorders, women and non-binary people, LGBTQIA+ persons, people of color, etc.)\nUnique methodological or statistical approaches to conducting correctional research or evaluating the effectiveness of new policies  \n\nFor general inquiries, prospective contributors may contact Dr. Ashley Batastini (Ashley.batastini@memphis.edu).\n \nManuscripts must be submitted through the journal’s online submission portal in accordance with specified formatting guidelines. Once in the portal, there will be a drop-down option to designate your submission for consideration in this special section.

The extension of the specialty guidelines is especially relevant for many of our members and will allow for the APA Ethics Committee to finish its work revising the APA Ethics Code before the specialty guidelines expire, as the revised code could inform revisions to the specialty guidelines. \n \nCouncil members remembered APA members who died since we last met. Your Council representatives along with a representative from Division 42 rose to remember Kento Yasuhara.\n \nThe proposal for a new Committee for the Advancement of General Applied Psychology passed, with 91.1% of the Council voting to establish committee. This new group will provide a home within APA for activities designed to advance applied psychological science and research outside of the direct delivery of mental health services. The committee will provide new opportunities for APLS members to get involved in APA. As the Chair of the Caucus on General Applied Psychology and Psychologists, your representative Margaret Bull Kovera worked with the movers of this proposal to educate other Council members on the unaddressed needs that could be addressed by creating this new governance structure within APA. Close to 95% of Council voted to support the new applied general psychology committee's request to perform an annual self-assessment and establish liaison relationships across APA governance. \n \nCouncil discussed and voted on a resolution on Confidentiality and Reproductive Health, which was approved with a vote of 96.7% in favor. The resolution emphasizes the importance of confidentiality within the psychology profession and addresses when psychologists are faced with ethical conflicts with law.\n \nCouncil overwhelmingly (97%) voted to approve a report on an offer of apology to First Peoples in the United States.\n \n97% of Council voted to approve educational guidelines for equitable and respectful treatment of students in graduate psychology training programs. \n \nCouncil voted on whether to create an exception to Keesey’s procedures so that new business items can be added to Council agenda with a 50%+1 vote rather than a 2/3 vote in favor, when any objections had been raised to adding the item.  This proposal was rejected by 70% of Council after extensive discussion.  \n \nIt is now possible for new business items to be discussed at the plenary meeting prior to the official start of Council business – 67.1% of Council voted in favor of this new practice. \n \nThere was a discussion about a motion to remove the requirement for the Council Leadership Team (CLT), and Boards and committees that have reviewed a new business item to provide an opinion on the item before it is considered in final form. After some discussion, 57% of Council voted to postpone a vote on this motion until the August meeting when the Council will receive a report on an evaluation of the effectiveness of the CLT. \n \n96.1% of Council voted to approve a change to the association rules so that all members of the Board of Directors (BoD) will be subject to the same review prior to being slated for election to a BoD seat as had previously been applied only to candidates for members-at-large seat. Your representatives successfully lobbied in advance of the Council meeting to have a felony status question removed from the review process.  \n \n88% of Council voted to postpone discussion of changes to simultaneous services election-related rules until its next meeting in August. \n \nThen, 66% of Council voted to create a three-year Council liaison pilot program between Council and selected APA Boards/Committees. \n \nCouncil then had a thoughtful discussion about the APA Strategic Plan and how APA, guided by psychological science, can address important societal issues in the next 3-5 years. \n \nCouncil approved Resolution on Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in Quality Continuing Education and Professional Development, with 93.3% voting in favor of the resolution. \n \nCouncil (93.7%) postponed until August a vote on a new procedure for improving the diversity impact statement statements that accompany new business items to give the movers more time to refine motion. Jason Cantone has volunteered to assist the movers in this revision process.  \n \nAs always, if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to either of your APA Council Representatives.  \n \nRespectfully submitted,\n \nMargaret Bull Kovera (on behalf of herself and Jason Cantone)\nPlaceholder for more text coming.\n  \n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n  \n    \n      \n        \n           \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n  AP-LS 2023 Conference\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n  \n    AP-LS is just a few weeks away!

This competitive program replaces NSF’s successful and longstanding Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant (DDRIG) program in Law and Science. The award to ASU provides funding of up to $20,000 apiece to doctoral students in diverse law-and-science disciplines (e.g., anthropology, criminal justice, economics, forensic science, political science, psychology, sociology) to conduct their dissertation research.\n \nThe next submission deadline is May 15, 2023, at 11:59 p.m. MST. Annual deadlines will be on May 15 and November 15 (or the first business day thereafter if the date falls on a weekend or federal holiday). Please spread the word to any students who might be interested in funding their dissertation research through this grant.\nFor more information about the LSDG program, please visit (and share) our website.\nIf you have any questions pertaining to the LSDG program, you may complete the ‘Contact Us’ form included on the website.\n \n  \n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n  \n    \n      \n        \n           \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n  Call for Book Proposals\n\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n  \n    The American Psychology-Law Society invites proposals for new titles in its book series, which is now published by APA Books. We publish authored and edited volumes on current issues at the intersection of psychology and law. Books are typically a state-of-the-science synthesis of a body of existing research with implications for practice and/or policy.\n \nAuthors and editors should have a substantial and recent track record of publication and/or practice in psychology or law, and at least one should hold a doctorate in psychology or closely related behavioral science. If you have a proposal for a new book in the series or you would simply like more information, reach out to a member of the editorial team.

For example, we provide multiple grants opportunities and recognize members through a range of awards for teaching, research and mentorship. We also hold an Annual Conference, participate in the APA Annual Convention, have an active book series, and are the home for our flagship journal, Law and Human Behavior.\nOne of our most important resources is our incredibly active Student Committee. The Student Committee oversees a range of resources and funding opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and Early Career Professionals. For those of you who may be new to the organization, we have a series of short videos that were developed by our Broadening Representative Inclusion, Diversity, and Global Equity, or BRIDGE Committee (formerly our Minority Affairs Committee). Our BRIDGE Committee is also the steward of several awards and grants that align with our organizational commitment to goals centered around diversity, equity, and inclusion.\nAs you navigate our webpages, I hope you’ll find the many resources available for research, education and teaching, and careers in psychology and law. In addition, to keep abreast of the latest news in psychology and law, check out our monthly newsletter.\nAP-LS is a dynamic, diverse and multifaceted organization, and we are committed to our vision and mission through our values: the pursuit of excellence, knowledge and application based on methods of science, outstanding service to our members and to society, values of social justice, diversity, and inclusion, and ethical action in all we do. More information about our goals, mission, and strategic plan can be found on our About page.\nThank you for visiting our website, and please feel free to reach out to our any members of the Executive Committee with questions or more information about psychology and law. And, please connect with us on social media. We’re on facebook, twitter, and instagram.\nInterested in joining? Please find details about membership on our site, and we look forward to welcoming you into our organization!\nBarry Rosenfeld\nPresident, American Psychology-Law Society"

Because the Association is organized under the laws of the District of Columbia, the Association and its divisions, including the Society, cannot make decisions in settings other than those in which all of the board members (or Executive Committee members) can hear one another speak on the topic to be decided. As such, Society business should be carried out using face-to-face, telephone, or web-based meetings whenever possible. If the Society conducts a vote over email, unanimous approval is required; unanimous approval means that every eligible voting member must respond and everyone must agree.\nThe Executive Committee shall meet at least twice annually at the Association’s annual convention and the Society’s annual conference. Other meetings may be held on the call of the President, by consensus of the Secretary and Treasurer, or by consensus of a simple majority of the Executive Committee. All outgoing and incoming members of the Executive Committee should be present at the annual meeting of the Executive Committee (held in conjunction with the Association’s annual convention).

In addition, the Society will prepare programming as Division 41 for the annual Association convention.\nThe Society shall publish a newsletter and maintain a web page for purposes of coordinating and disseminating news relevant to the membership of the Society.\n\nAs a part of its mandate, the newsletter or web page shall publish the minutes of each Executive Committee meeting, the annual budget for the Society, announcements of the petition process as outlined in Article IV, Section 4(a) of these By-Laws, and final nominations for Society offices.\nThe editors of the newsletter and web page shall be nominated by the Nominations and Awards Committee, in consultation with the Publications and Communications Committee, such appointment subject to the approval of the Executive Committee. The editors shall be appointed to three-year terms and shall serve as ex-officio, non-voting members of the Executive Committee. By mutual consent of the newsletter editor or web page editor and the Executive Committee, the appointments may be extended for one additional three-year term, for a maximum of six years.\n\nThe Society shall publish journals with the goal of disseminating results of research and scholarly writing in the area of psychology and law. The Editor of a Journal shall be nominated by the Nominations and Awards Committee, in consultation with the Publications and Communications Committee and the (Outgoing) Editor. The Nominations and Awards Committee shall provide a list of two or three eligible candidates to the Executive Committee for consideration. The appointment of an Incoming Editor is subject to the approval of the Executive Committee and shall be made at least 18 months prior to the end of an Editor’s term. Beginning in January of an (outgoing) Editor’s final year, the appointed candidate serves as an Incoming Editor for a one-year period. An Incoming Editor receives all new submissions and is mentored by the Editor. Following the one-year term as an Incoming Editor, an Editor serves a six -year term. In the last of this six-year term, an Editor serves as a mentor to the new Incoming Editor.\nAn Editor assumes all Editor responsibilities during the six-year term. An Editor’s term is non-renewable but may be extended for up to two-years by majority vote of the Executive Committee. The extension should occur only under extenuating circumstances. An Editor may resign early through written notification to the President or may apply to the Executive Committee for a leave-of-absence. An Editor’s responsibilities include appointing the Associate Editors, Editorial Board, and Ad-Hoc Reviewers; soliciting manuscripts; managing the peer-review and publication processes; serving as a liaison with the publisher; reporting to the Executive Committee; representing the journal to all constituencies; and coordinating all other journal operations. An Editor takes a lead role in publication contract negotiations that occur during the Editor’s term (all contracts must be approved by the Executive Committee). An Editor manages the journal’s Editorial Budget and in so doing gives consideration to the needs of the Associate Editors and Incoming Editor. Editors shall serve as ex-officio, non-voting members of the Executive Committee. In the year in which there is both an Incoming and Outgoing Editor, the Outgoing Editor serves as the ex-officio, non-voting member of the Executive Committee.\nThe Society shall publish a book series with the goal of disseminating results of research and scholarly writing in the area of psychology and law. The editor of the book series shall be nominated by the Nominations and Awards Committee, in consultation with the Publications and Communications Committee, such appointment subject to the approval of the Executive Committee. The Editor shall be appointed for a five-year term and shall serve as a non-voting, ex-officio member of the Executive Committee. By mutual consent of the book series Editor and the Executive Committee, the appointment may be extended for an additional five-year term, for a maximum of ten years.\n\n\n\nArticle VI: Amendments\n\nAmendments to these By-Laws may be proposed by a majority vote of the Executive Committee or by a majority vote of the membership present at any annual meeting. Ratification of the proposed amendment requires a two-thirds majority of those of the membership voting, or by a two-thirds vote of those members attending any annual meeting. In either case, notice of the vote on the proposed By-Law Amendment must be published and made widely available to the membership prior to when the vote on the proposed By-Law Amendment occurs."

    "text": "Statement on Racism, Prejudice and HateStatement in Response to the Atlanta-area March 2021 Deaths\n\n\nThe mission of the American Psychology-Law Society is to enhance well-being, justice, and human rights through the science and practice of psychology in legal contexts. We stand strongly against racism, prejudice, and hate in all its forms. The tragic deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade, and countless other Black, Indigenous, and People of Color are unacceptable. These instances of horrific violence once again illustrate the profound systemic inequities and injustices toward marginalized and oppressed communities in the United States and around the world broadly and more specifically in our criminal justice, civil justice, legal, and carceral systems.\nWe recognize that racism does not occur in isolation, and its effects are heightened for people who also experience discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, social class, religion, immigration status, and other identities. Likewise, the negative effects of racism multiply across contexts. Recently, racial/ethnic disparities related to COVID-19, health care access, and the spread of COVID-19 in criminal and juvenile justice systems have magnified these profound inequities and injustices.\nWe believe that, through research, education, and training, better policies and practices can be developed to make the criminal justice, civil justice, legal, and carceral systems more equitable, just, and responsive to the needs of the communities in which they work.\nAs AP-LS members, we must engage in dialogue and action to create change within our society, our educational and legal institutions, and in our communities. We must engage in stronger efforts that support equity, inclusion, and just outcomes through our research, practice, teaching, and other professional activities. As a society, we seek to join other organizations to promote justice, put a spotlight on injustice, and condemn racism in all its forms. We stand together with Black, Indigenous, and Communities of Color and other oppressed groups and recommit to working together to ensure justice for all.\n\n\n\nSoon after the tragedy involving the death of George Floyd, AP-LS issued a statement in solidarity and to entrench our strong stand against hate in all forms. In response to the senseless killings of eight individuals in the Atlanta, Georgia area, largely because of the intersectionality of their gender and Asian heritage, AP-LS issues a second statement. AP-LS is committed to finding ways to combat prejudice and discrimination through the research, teaching, and practice of psychological science and law. For further resources and to see the statement issued by the Asian American Psychological Association {{<\n\nThe mission of the American Psychology-Law Society is to enhance well-being, justice, and human rights through the science and practice of psychology in legal contexts. We stand strongly against misogyny, racism, prejudice, and hate in all forms. On March 16, 2021, eight individuals, including six women of Asian heritage, were senselessly gunned down in the larger Atlanta, Georgia area.\nTheir names are: Soon Chung Park, Hyun Jung Grant, Suncha Kim, Yong AeYue, Delaina Ashley Yaun, Paul Andre Michels, Xiaojie Tan, and Daoyou Feng.These tragic deaths and countless others because of skin color, gender, and background—and their intersection—are unacceptable. Instances of violence and hate against Asian and Asian American/Pacific Islanders (AAPI) in particular have been on the rise; according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, Anti-Asian hate crime rose 149% in 2020, despite a 7% decrease in hate crime overall.\nMarch 8, 2021, a mere eight days before the Atlanta-area killings, we celebrated International Women's Day. The theme of this year's International Women's Day was \"Choose to Challenge.\" That is, the theme was to make the choice to challenge and call out bias and inequality against women when we see it—and to raise your right hand in support and commitment.\nAs a society, AP-LS chooses to raise our right hand for the individuals killed on March 16, 2021, especially those targeted because of their intersectional identity as Asian women. We raise our right hand against all forms of bias, discrimination, prejudice, and inequality. We recognize that prejudice does not occur in isolation, and its effects are heightened for people who experience discrimination based on gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, social class, religion, immigration status, and other identities—and the intersection of these.As AP-LS members, we must engage in dialogue and action to create change within our society, our educational and legal institutions, and in our communities. We must speak out against hate, violence, and inequality whenever and wherever it occurs. We must continue to engage in stronger efforts that support equity, inclusion, and just outcomes through our research, practice, teaching, and other professional activities. We are committed to working together to ensure justice for all."

    "text": "Psychology and law as a scholarly and professional field did not appear spontaneously and fully formed. The leaves and branches are visible, but the roots are the elements from which everything grew. Knowing and understanding the roots and how our own tree of knowledge grew tells a lot about who we are and where we came from. The emergence of psychology and law as a modern field of scholarship was marked by the founding of the American Psychology-Law Society.\n\n\n\nThomas Grisso & Stanley L. Brodsky in The Roots of Modern Psychology and Law: A Narrative History, p. xiii\n\n\nWhile Munsterberg’s (1908) On the Witness Stand: Essays on Psychology and Crime is often credited as the seed to the law-psychology discipline, the field did not truly take root until the 1970s. Following a dormant period (1930s to 1960s), law-psychology was reawakened for several reasons including: the development of clinical and social psychology as disciplines working within legal contexts; consciousness in human rights, civil liberties, and social justice; and federal case law supporting clinical psychologists providing testimony (Jenkins v. U.S., 1962) and agencies developed to support scientific research (Center for Crime and Delinquency, first directed by Saleem Shah).\nIn 1968, at the American Psychological Association (APA) convention in San Francisco, thirteen psychologists, initiated by a psychologist and lawyer Jay Ziskin (and first president), met and discussed the intersection of psychology and law and conceptualized a society to support law-psychology interdisciplinary work. The next year, there was a mimeographed newsletter and 101 charter members, with $202 in funds that were generated from the $2 dues of each member.\nThe first conference was held in San Francisco in June 1974, with approximately 20 to 30 presenter/attendees. In 1977, Bruce Sales established both the law-psychology book series and Law and Human Behavior (LHB). A few years later, LHB was designated the official journal of AP-LS. Then in 1981, AP-LS became Division 41 of the American Psychological Association.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrisso, T., & Brodsky, S. L. (Eds.). (2018).

The intent of this grant initiative is to advance a more interdisciplinary science that addresses understudied topics in psychology and law, as well as to broaden the discipline and amplify its practical impact. Proposed projects must investigate new or understudied topics in psychology and law, enhance the diversification of psychology and law research through novel theoretical or methodological approaches that are cross-disciplinary in nature, and/or promote the impact of research by considering novel populations or new problems or processes within the legal system; the proposed project is to include collaboration with practitioners or policymakers. Successful proposals are expected to involve projects with the potential to transform and impact the field by furthering novel lines of research inquiry and/or facilitating new cross-disciplinary collaborations.\nAs part of the AP-LS initiative toward a more inclusive society, grant applicatios that specifically address disadvantaged groups or understudied topic areas in psychology and law will be given preference. This includes funding scholars from traditionally underprivileged backgrounds.\nProposals may be submitted into one of two funding categories:\n\nSmall/Seed proposals ($1,000-$5,000 for a 12-month research period)\nLarge proposals ($15,000-$50,000 over a 12-18 month research period)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFunding should primarily support research activities and data collection efforts. Support for research assistants and necessary travel may be requested, but should not constitute the majority of the requested funds. No funds can be used to support the salary of the principal investigator (PI) or co-PI.\nFunds for successful proposals will be awarded to the PI’s academic institution (via the institution’s Office of Sponsored Research or Foundation). No institutional indirect cost recovery will be permitted, and proposals submitted for consideration by this program must not be submitted for consideration by other grant programs (including AP-LS programs).\nProposals submitted but not funded in previous funding cycles may be resubmitted, but all proposals will be evaluated as new proposals.\n\n\n\n\nApplicants may submit only one small and one large proposal per funding cycle.\nA student cannot be a sole PI on any submission but are allowed to be a co-PI on a submission.\nAt least one of the co-PIs needs to be an AP-LS member.\n\n\nInterested researchers should submit a 1,000-word prospectus to the committee by October 15 at 11:59 p.m. PST. All materials are submitted through the Div. 41 (AP-LS) awards page.\nClick to Apply\nThe prospectus should include four sections:\n\nDescribe the project in no more than 500 words.\nDescribe how the project contributes to the research initiative in no more than 500 words (See review criteria outlined below).\nA reference list (Does not count toward the word limit).\nSuggestions for three proposal reviewers. Suggested reviewers should not include anyone who might have a significant conflict of interest in reviewing the proposal (defined under full proposal “significant collaborators”).

ECPs face a number of unique challenges and issues when making the transition from graduate study to professional life. More than ever, today’s ECPs are likely to struggle with juggling multiple roles. Challenges faced by ECPs include financial concerns or strains, meeting licensure requirements, developing a professional identify, obtaining tenure, and enhancement of health and wellness, among other issues (Green & Hawley, 2009).\nThe purpose of this award is to support AP-LS members who are ECPs in conducting research related to psychology and law. It is the committee’s desire that these awards are not limited only to members who are psychologists, but instead open to AP-LS members from all backgrounds.\nAward amounts\nFunding up to $5,000 per award is available.\nFunding should primarily support research activities and data collection efforts (e.g., equipment, participant payments, software data transcription, hourly payment for research assistants, and expenses incurred at sites away from the home institution while collecting data). Travel to conferences and salary expenses are not eligible costs.\nFunds for successful proposals will be awarded to the PI’s academic institution (via the institution’s Office of Sponsored Research or Foundation). No institutional indirect cost recovery will be permitted.\n\n\nTo receive an award:\n\nThe applicant must be an Early Career Professional, defined by APA as those within ten years of receiving their last degree.\nApplicants and any co-applicants must be classified as ECPs upon the application deadline for that year.\nApplicants may submit only one award proposal per funding cycle. In addition, to maximize the impact of the program, a strong preference will be given to those applicants who never have received an AP-LS ECP Grants-in-Aid.\nUnder exceptional circumstances, the committee may consider a second award. The possibility of a second award will be a rare occurrence, and the previous award must be completed prior to submitting a second proposal.\nProposals that represent “seed money” for larger projects and proposals that are for “standalone” projects will be accepted.\nApplicants are encouraged but not required to secure matched funding from employers to support the proposed research.\nAll applicants and any co-applicants must be active members of AP-LS.\nStudents are not eligible to receive an award.\n\n\n\nSubmit a complete proposal to the online portal by October 15 at 11:59 PST.\nClick to Apply\nA complete application includes:\n\nA short grant proposal (see proposal instructions and guidelines for details)\nA project timeline and a proposed budget (see proposal instructions and guidelines for details)\nA CV for each PI and co-PI contributing to the project, including a list of “significant collaborators” that includes dissertation and master’s thesis advisors, current and past students, co-authors within the last 5 years, editors who have edited a book in which you have a chapter published, and authors who have published in a book you have edited\nSuggestions for at least five suggested reviewers for the project with expertise in the content area of the proposal: Suggested reviewers should not include anyone who might have a significant conflict of interest in reviewing the proposal (defined as “significant collaborators” in CV section).

The AP program primarily targets undergraduate students, but students from terminal master’s degree programs will also be considered.\n\n\n\n\nLink to Apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAward applications should include:\n\n\n\n\nA cover letter that provides contact information for both the student and the mentor\nA one-to-two page personal statement written by the student that addresses the following issues:\n\nstudent’s interest in the field of psychology and law, either in general or with respect to a particular issue in the field\nstudent’s educational and career goals\nstudent’s current qualifications and experiences for achieving those goals. All students should provide their current overall and psychology-specific GPAs.\nStudents also may discuss any personal characteristics or life experiences that are relevant to proposed project\n\nA two-to-three-page description of the proposed research experience\n\n\nStudents should discuss the research activities they will engage in with their mentors\nA description of the topic of the proposed research, providing as much detail about the project as well as the specific research tasks in which the student will engage. It is not necessary for students to complete an independent project, but they need to obtain meaningful experience that will help them be competitive for graduate school.\n\n\nThe research proposal should include the following, to the extent possible: - brief introduction/background to the project - brief description of the method, including participants, measures, and procedures\n\n\nA letter of support from the faculty member discussing the applicant’s potential for graduate work, interest in psychology and law, and ability to complete the proposed research experience. In addition, the faculty member should discuss his or her anticipated strategy for mentoring the student (e.g., amount of contact, training methods, plans for monitoring progress)\nA completed W-9 (U.S. citizen) or W-8 (noncitizen) tax form\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents in the AP program are required to:\n\nwork on research for approximately 10 hours per week for the duration of their research experience;\nparticipate in GRE classes and/or other development opportunities;\nattend an AP-LS conference;\nsubmit a proposal to present their research at an AP-LS conference or in the Div. 41 program of an APA conference;\nsubmit a summary of their research experience to the BRIDGE chair within one month of its completion;\ncorrespond with a secondary mentor from the BRIDGE Committee;\nparticipate in the ongoing assessment of the AP program.\n\nFaculty mentors in the AP program are required to:\n\nclosely supervise their students to ensure that they have a meaningful research experience that will make them more competitive for graduate school;\nhelp identify and facilitate opportunities for their students to participate in GRE classes and/or other development programs offered on their campuses (e.g., through the McNair program);\nassist their students in making a conference presentation about their research;\nparticipate in the ongoing assessment of the AP program"

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThe Saleem Shah Award is co-sponsored by the American Psychology-Law Society and the American Academy of Forensic Psychology (AAFP).\nNominations should be sent in PDF or Word format to the President-Elect of the AAFP\nAbout Saleem ShahSubmit Nomination\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistoryDescriptionEligibilityHow to Apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAt the 2012 AP-LS Conference there was a session titled:“Saleem’s Rules: Lessons in Mentoring, Knowing What’s Right, and Changing the World - Why AP-LS Created a Saleem Shah Award” with speakers Thomas Grisso, Henry J. Steadman, Edward Mulvey and John Monahan. Dr. Grisso wrote an article about that panel’s discussions for the Summer 2012 AP-LS News newsletter.\nYou can download a summary of that discussion below.\n Saleems Rules \n\n\nSaleem A. Shah, who was internationally known for his leadership in the field of law and mental health, died on Nov. 25, 1992, from injuries suffered when his automobile was struck by a drunken driver. Saleem was born on December 2, 1931, in Allahabad, India. After receiving a BA from Allahabad University, he came to the United States on a fellowship and earned his PhD in clinical psychology at Pennsylvania State University in 1957. He served as a graduate psychology intern at Spring Grove State Hospital, outside Baltimore, where he met his wife, Terry, with whom he had six daughters, all of whom survive him. After leaving Penn State, Saleem joined the Legal Psychiatric Services Division of the Department of Public Health in Washington, DC. He rose quickly to the post of chief psychologist and held this position until he joined the staff of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in 1966.\nSaleem remained at NIMH for the rest of his professional life. From 1968 to 1987, he was the chief of an extramural research program originally known as the Center for Studies of Crime and Delinquency and later as the Antisocial and Violent Behavior Branch. The scope of this program was extremely broad, covering such issues as the biology of antisocial behavior, delinquency, violence, and law and mental health studies. Saleem’s mastery of this entire interdisciplinary program soon made him a legend inside and outside NIMH, but his greatest interest was always the field of law and mental health, which he saw as encompassing the full range of interactions between the legal and mental health systems (see Law and Mental Health: Major Developments and Research Needs, 1991, with Bruce Sales).\nSaleem’s personal contributions to his field can perhaps be summed up as follows. He was committed, first and foremost, to the goal of achieving fair and equitable treatment for mentally disordered offenders and other persons whose mental status was at issue before the law. In his numerous scientific publications, he repeatedly drew attention to the tension between the therapeutic and the social control objectives of mental health laws and to the need for careful analysis of underlying constructs to establish a clear ethical and legal basis for policies and programs. As his writings on these topics became widely known, he was increasingly asked to give lectures and consultations in other countries, such as Germany, the former Soviet Union, and China.\nWhat Saleem could not do on his own, he accomplished through others. In 1968 he established law and mental health studies as a formal program priority for NIMH and became the guide and mentor for a new generation of scholars who by their empirical and theoretical work, much of it supported by NIMH, transformed the field of law and mental health studies: Thomas Grisso, John Monahan, Loren Roth, Bruce Sales, Henry Steadman, Linda Teplin, and David Wexler, to name but a few. Saleem also initiated an NIMH monograph series for the purpose of making current knowledge and research findings in law and mental health more readily available to policymakers and other potential users. More than 20 volumes were published during Saleem’s lifetime on topics such as clinical prediction of violent behavior, competency to stand trial, mental health services in local jails, and clinical treatment of violent persons.\nSaleem received many honors. He was the first recipient of the American Psychology-Law Society Award for Distinguished Contributions to Psychology and Law; he also received the Isaac Ray Award of the American Psychiatric Association for outstanding contributions in law and mental health and six U.S. government awards.\n\n\nThe Saleem Shah Award recognizes early career excellence and contributions to the field of psychology and law. The focus on the nominee’s contributions may be in any area of forensic practice, research or public policy.\nThe award is conferred annually at the AP-LS Annual Conference.

Practitioners are in a unique position to offer education, assessment, intervention and advocacy on issues of REC disparities, racism, and discrimination in the field of psychology and the law. However, a limited body of research, lack of practice guidelines on REC integration in forensic practice, and low representation of Black, Indigenous, People Of Color (BIPOC) professionals, limit such efforts. Mentorship of emerging practitioners in psychology and the law on such issues can bridge the gap of knowledge, application, and BIPOC representation in the field.\nThe AP-LS Practice Committee wants to recognize the substantive contributions of practitioner mentors who educate and support emerging clinicians in psychology and the law with a lens toward the elimination of REC disparities and social justice. For these purposes, we use Goldstein’s (2007) definition of the practice of psychology and the law: “The application of psychological research, theory, practice, and traditional and specialized methodology (e.g. interviewing, psychological testing, forensic assessment, and forensically relevant instruments) to provide information relevant to a legal question.”\nThe award for Outstanding Practitioner Mentoring to Eliminate Racial, Ethnic and Cultural (REC) Disparities in the Field of Psychology and the Law, will be conferred on a yearly basis. The recipient will receive a $500 cash award, a plaque to be presented at the annual AP-LS conference, and will be featured in an AP-LS newsletter article, written by the practice committee, highlighting the recipient’s achievements and recommendations to other practitioners. Highlighting the recipient’s mentorship practices and experiences can serve as a model for other professionals in the field of psychology and the law.\n\nReferences\nGoldstein, A.M. (2007).

It can also be so-called “informal mentorship” where the mentor has dedicated their personal time to assist and support emerging clinicians outside formal institutional affiliations (e.g. an African American forensic psychologist who regularly mentors other BIPOC early career psychologists in their area).\nExcellence in mentorship can take many shapes and forms. A common thread would be mentoring emerging clinicians, regardless of race or ethnicity, on using their specialized skills and knowledge as forensic psychologists to reduce REC disparities.\nThe practitioner’s mentorship has had a significant impact in the system in which they operate (e.g. supporting increased training opportunities on BIPOC issues, helping increase BIPOC representation in the field of psychology and the law, supporting antiracist professional identities for emerging forensic psychologists).\nSelf-nominations are encouraged; the candidate does not have to be an AP-LS member.\n\n\nThe nomination package should be converted into a PDF file and emailed directly to the chair of the award committee. Self-nominations are encouraged; the candidate does not have to be an AP-LS member.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNomination package (max 25 pages) should include:\n\n\n\n\nNominee’s statement (~1-2 pages) describing how the nominated psychologist meets the criteria for the award, their focus and approach to mentoring and how it centers BIPOC issues. For example, their support of BIPOC trainees/staff under their supervision and/or work with non-BIPOC trainees/staff on issues relevant to BIPOC populations in psychology and the law. It should also include their goals and accomplishments associated with the field of psychology and the law\nA copy of the nominee’s curriculum vitae\nA letter of support from a mentee (e.g. former or current) focusing on the impact the individual had in their professional development and understanding of BIPOC issues in FMH."

All email communications will come from caps@paloaltou.eduPlease make sure this email is whitelisted on your email provider.\n\n\n\nWhat to expect at the conference\n\nTo receive CEs for a conference session, you must attend the session in its entirety. There will be sign-in/sign-out sheets for each session located at the back of the room; please print your full name & email address clearly to document your attendance at the session. This must be done for each CE session you attend.\nYou must complete an evaluation for each CE-eligible session you attend. The evaluation links for each day of the conference will be sent via email prior to the start of the first session. Please do not access these links until after each of the live conference sessions.\nYou will be able to download & save a PDF certificate upon completion of the evaluation. A copy will also be emailed to the email used at registration within 1-week of the close of the conference.\nIf you need support from CONCEPT for CE/Certificate needs, please visit the CONCEPT booth (between Franklin Hall and the escalators) during the conference.\n\n\n\n\n\nSymposia, Paper, and Data Blitz Sessions\nSymposia sessions are 80 minutes long and paper and data blitz sessions are 60 minutes long. All sessions will have an assigned chair who will be responsible for ensuring that approximately 10 minutes are reserved for questions. The remaining time should be divided evenly across all the scheduled presenters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDanger\n\n\n\nWhile Audio/Visual should be available in session rooms, note that Internet will not be. Thus, presenters need to ensure that their A/V content is stored on their computer and thumb drive so that it can be transferred to the session room computer and played locally.\n\n\n\n\nPosters\nPoster Sizing: The poster boards for mounting a poster are 4 ft (height) x 8 ft (width). Presenters are free to print any size poster that will fit within this space. Pushpins will be provided.\nPoster Board Numbering: Posters are numbered in the conference program so that the number for the poster indicates the correct board on which the poster should be hung. Poster presenters should refer to these numbers to identify the poster board to hang their poster.\n\n\n\nPre-conference Workshops will take place on Wednesday March 15.\nLearn more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2023 AP-LS Program Grid and Schedule is available to download and view online!\nConference Program"

Membership in AP-LS is therefore separate and independent from membership in Division 41 of APA, although many members belong to both organizations (AP-LS and APA).\nMembers of AP-LS enjoy a variety of benefits including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline access to the official journal of AP-LS, Law and Human Behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline subscription to the AP-LS monthly newsletter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEligibility to apply for grants, fellowships, and awards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscounts on AP-LS conference registration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbility to vote in annual AP-LS elections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess to additional resources and networking opportunties.\n\n\n\n\nWho can join?\nMembership is open to interested professionals and students in other disciplines beyond psychology. AP-LS encourages APA members, graduate and undergraduate students, and persons in related fields to consider joining.\nMembership Types\nThere are six categories of membership in AP-LS including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull\n\nIndividuals with a doctoral degree (Ph.D., Psy.D., M.D., or Ed.D.) in psych or related field or a Juris Doctorate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate\n\nInviduals with a master's degree in psych or related field or a terminal bachelors degree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly Career\n\nIndividuals within 10 years of receiving latest degree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFellows\n\nIndividuals granted Fellow Status (Full Members) or Distinguished Member status (Full Afilliates) by the society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational\n\nIndividuals who reside outside the United States with a relevant doctoral degree. All join as International Affiliates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent\n\nIndividuals currently enrolled in undergraduate or graduate program.
