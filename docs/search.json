The purpose of this interactive workshop was to highlight some of the potential causes of the lack of diversity, particularly racial and ethnic diversity, in the field and to offer some potential solutions to this problem. Panelists provided suggestions on how to improve recruitment and retention of diverse people in academic, research, and clinical settings. In addition, strategies that individuals can use to address discrimination in their academic or work settings were discussed.\nSponsored by:\nAP-LS Corrections Committee, AP-LS BRIDGE Committee and ICPF"

    "text": "The field of psychology has embraced video communication technologies (VCT) in an effort to match existing social norms and reach clients who may otherwise have limited options for local providers, face increased costs and lost wages for travel to clinics, or go without services altogether. Beyond this, remote technologies have become a necessity following the COVID-19 pandemic for sustaining clinical practices and safely engaging clients. VCT is exploding across the globe, with many considering it as a sort of savior in the fight to resolve the mental health crisis.\nGiven the high demand for pre-trial evaluations (Antonacci, et al., 2008; Deslich et al., 2013), rural location of many correctional facilities, and increased risk of infection in total confinement, the use of VCT is increasingly used to assess and treat justice-involved persons. While commentary and research are emerging (see e.g., Batastini et al., 2016; Luxton & Lexcen, 2018), practitioners, scholars, and policymakers remain in need of clear guidance for improving the efficiency and quality of telecare.\nThis program includes a multidisciplinary group of panelists who will provide real-world examples, interactive critical thinking exercises, and empirically driven recommendations that will not only interest those working within the legal system, but also those broadly looking to integrate telepsychology into their practice or research program. Panelists will cover topics including establishing a remote jail-based competency restoration program, improving the science of conducting and reporting forensic telepsychology initiatives, overcoming unique barriers to privacy and confidentiality in carceral settings, developing an infrastructure for telehealth networks, and drafting discipline-specific best practice guidelines. Embedded within these talks, panelists will also address considerations for rural and diverse clients. The session will conclude with a general discussion and Q&A with the panelists using pre-selected questions. APA Divisions supporting this program include: 12, 14, 18, 41 (lead division), 42, and 46.\nPresenters:\n\nAshley B. Batastini, Ph.D.- University of Memphis\nTomina J.

    "text": "1.01 Integrity Forensic practitioners strive for accuracy, honesty, and truthfulness in the science, teaching, and practice of forensic psychology and they strive to resist partisan pressures to provide services in any ways that might tend to be misleading or inaccurate.\n1.02 Impartiality and Fairness When offering expert opinion to be relied upon by a decision maker, providing forensic therapeutic services, or teaching or conducting research, forensic practitioners strive for accuracy, impartiality, fairness, and independence (EPPCC Standard 2.01). Forensic practitioners recognize the adversarial nature of the legal system and strive to treat all participants and weigh all data, opinions, and rival hypotheses impartially.\nWhen conducting forensic examinations, forensic practitioners strive to be unbiased and impartial, and avoid partisan presentation of unrepresentative, incomplete, or inaccurate evidence that might mislead finders of fact. This guideline does not preclude forceful presentation of the data and reasoning upon which a conclusion or professional product is based.\nWhen providing educational services, forensic practitioners seek to represent alternative perspectives, including data, studies, or evidence on both sides of the question, in an accurate, fair and professional manner, and strive to weigh and present all views, facts, or opinions impartially.\nWhen conducting research, forensic practitioners seek to represent results in a fair and impartial manner. Forensic practitioners strive to utilize research designs and scientific methods that adequately and fairly test the questions at hand, and they attempt to resist partisan pressures to develop designs or report results in ways that might be misleading or unfairly bias the results of a test, study, or evaluation.\n1.03 Avoiding Conflicts of Interest Forensic practitioners refrain from taking on a professional role when personal, scientific, professional, legal, financial, or other interests or relationships could reasonably be expected to impair their impartiality, competence, or effectiveness, or expose others with whom a professional relationship exists to harm (EPPCC Standard 3.06).\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to identify, make known, and address real or apparent conflicts of interest in an attempt to maintain the public confidence and trust, discharge professional obligations, and maintain responsibility, impartiality, and accountability (EPPCC Standard 3.06). Whenever possible, such conflicts are revealed to all parties as soon as they become known to the psychologist. Forensic practitioners consider whether a prudent and competent forensic practitioner engaged in similar circumstances would determine that the ability to make a proper decision is likely to become impaired under the immediate circumstances.\nWhen a conflict of interest is determined to be manageable, continuing services are provided and documented in a way to manage the conflict, maintain accountability, and preserve the trust of relevant others (also see Section 4.02 below)."

    "text": "11.01 Accuracy, Fairness, and Avoidance of Deception\nForensic practitioners make reasonable efforts to ensure that the products of their services, as well as their own public statements and professional reports and testimony, are communicated in ways that promote understanding and avoid deception (EPPCC Standard 5.01).\nWhen in their role as expert to the court or other tribunals, the role of forensic practitioners is to facilitate understanding of the evidence or dispute.\nConsistent with legal and ethical requirements, forensic practitioners do not distort or withhold relevant evidence or opinion in reports or testimony. When responding to discovery requests and providing sworn testimony, forensic practitioners strive to have readily available for inspection all data which they considered, regardless of whether the data supports their opinion, subject to and consistent with court order, relevant rules of evidence, test security issues, and professional standards (American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, in press; American Psychological Association Committee on Legal Issues, 2006; Bank & Packer, 2007; Golding, 1990).\nWhen providing reports and other sworn statements or testimony in any form, forensic practitioners strive to present their conclusions, evidence, opinions, or other professional products in a fair manner. Forensic practitioners do not, by either commission or omission, participate in misrepresentation of their evidence, nor do they participate in partisan attempts to avoid, deny or subvert the presentation of evidence contrary to their own position or opinion (EPPCC Standard 5.01). This does not preclude forensic practitioners from forcefully presenting the data and reasoning upon which a conclusion or professional product is based.\n\n\n11.02 Differentiating Observations, Inferences, and Conclusions\nIn their communications, forensic practitioners strive to distinguish observations, inferences, and conclusions. Forensic practitioners are encouraged to explain the relationship between their expert opinions and the legal issues and facts of the case at hand.\n\n\n11.03 Disclosing Sources of Information and Bases of Opinions\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to disclose all sources of information obtained in the course of their professional services, and to identify the source of each piece of information that was considered and relied upon in formulating a particular conclusion, opinion or other professional product.\n\n\n11.04 Comprehensive and Accurate Presentation of Opinions in Reports and Testimony\nConsistent with relevant law and rules of evidence, when providing professional reports and other sworn statements or testimony, forensic practitioners strive to offer a complete statement of all relevant opinions that they formed within the scope of their work on the case, the basis and reasoning underlying the opinions, the salient data or other information that was considered in forming the opinions, and an indication of any additional evidence that may be used in support of the opinions to be offered. The specific substance of forensic reports is determined by the type of psycholegal issue at hand as well as relevant laws or rules in the jurisdiction in which the work is completed.\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to limit discussion of background information that does not bear directly upon the legal purpose of the examination or consultation. Forensic practitioners avoid offering information that is irrelevant and that does not provide a substantial basis of support for their opinions, except when required by law (EPPCC Standard 4.04).\n\n\n11.05 Commenting Upon Other Professionals and Participants in Legal Proceedings\nWhen evaluating or commenting upon the work or qualifications of other professionals involved in legal proceedings, forensic practitioners seek to represent their disagreements in a professional and respectful tone, and base them on a fair examination of the data, theories, standards and opinions of the other expert or party.\nWhen describing or commenting upon clients, examinees, or other participants in legal proceedings, forensic practitioners strive to do so in a fair and impartial manner. Forensic practitioners strive to report the representations, opinions, and statements of clients, examinees, or other participants in a fair and impartial manner.\n\n\n11.06 Out of Court Statements\nOrdinarily, forensic practitioners seek to avoid making detailed public (out-of-court) statements about legal proceedings in which they have been involved. However, sometimes public statements may serve important goals such as educating the public about the role of forensic practitioners in the legal system, the appropriate practice of forensic psychology, and psychological and legal issues that are relevant to the matter at hand. When making public statements, forensic practitioners refrain from releasing private, confidential, or privileged information, and attempt to protect persons from harm, misuse, or misrepresentation as a result of their statements (EPPCC Standard 4.05).\n\n\n11.07 Commenting Upon Legal Proceedings\nForensic practitioners strive to address particular legal proceedings in publications or communications only to the extent that the information relied upon is part of a public record, or when consent for that use has been properly obtained from any party holding any relevant privilege (also see Section 8.04).\nWhen offering public statements about specific cases in which they have not been involved, forensic practitioners offer opinions for which there is sufficient information or data and make clear the limitations of their statements and opinions resulting from having had no direct knowledge of or involvement with the case (EPPCC Standard 9.01)."

    "text": "5.01 Determining Fees\nWhen determining fees forensic practitioners may consider salient factors such as their experience providing the service, the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, the skill required to perform the service, the fee customarily charged for similar forensic services, the likelihood that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment, the time limitations imposed by the client or circumstances, the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client, the client’s ability to pay for the service, and any legal requirements.\n\n\n5.02 Fee Arrangements\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to make clear to the client the likely cost of services whenever it is feasible, and make appropriate provisions in those cases in which the costs of services is greater than anticipated or the client’s ability to pay for services changes in some way.\nForensic practitioners seek to avoid undue influence that might result from financial compensation or other gains. Because of the threat to impartiality presented by the acceptance of contingent fees and associated legal prohibitions, forensic practitioners strive to avoid providing professional services on the basis of contingent fees. Letters of protection, financial guarantees, and other security for payment of fees in the future are not considered contingent fees unless payment is dependent on the outcome of the matter.\n\n\n5.03 Pro Bono Services\nForensic psychologists recognize that some persons may have limited access to legal services as a function of financial disadvantage and strive to contribute a portion of their professional time for little or no compensation or personal advantage (EPPCC Principle E)."

    "text": "The final version of the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists, prepared by the AP-LS Committee on the Revision of the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology, was adopted by APA Council of Representatives on Aug. 3, 2011. The guidelines appeared in American Psychologist and are available for  Download Forensic Guidelines .\nFor other professional guidelines from APA, go here\n\nApplicationDefinitions & TerminologyBackground & History\n\n\nThe Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists applies as follows:\nFor the purposes of these Guidelines, forensic psychology refers to professional practice by any psychologist working within any sub-discipline of psychology (e.g., clinical, developmental, social, cognitive) when applying the scientific, technical, or specialized knowledge of psychology to the law to assist in addressing legal, contractual, and administrative matters. Application of the Guidelines does not depend on the practitioner’s typical areas of practice or expertise, but rather on the service provided in the case at hand. These Guidelines apply in all matters in which psychologists provide expertise to judicial, administrative, and educational systems including, but not limited to, examining or treating persons in anticipation of or subsequent to legal, contractual, administrative, proceedings; offering expert opinion about psychological issues in the form of amicus briefs or testimony to judicial, legislative or administrative bodies; acting in an adjudicative capacity; serving as a trial consultant or otherwise offering expertise to attorneys, the courts, or others; conducting research in connection with, or in the anticipation of, litigation; or involvement in educational activities of a forensic nature.\n\n\nFor the purposes of these Guidelines:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory of the Guidelines\nThe previous version of the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists (Committee on Ethical Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists, 1991) was approved by the American Psychology-Law Society, Division 41 of the American Psychological Association, and the American Academy of Forensic Psychology in 1991. The current revision, now called the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology (referred to as Guidelines throughout this document), replace the 1991 Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists.\n\n\nRevision Process\nThis revision of the Guidelines was coordinated by the Committee for the Revision of the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology, which was established by the American Academy of Forensic Psychology and the American Psychology-Law Society (Division 41 of the American Psychological Association) in 2002 and operated through 2011. This Committee consisted of two representatives from each organization (Solomon Fulero, PhD, JD, Stephen Golding, PhD, ABPP, Lisa Piechowski, PhD, ABPP, Christina Studebaker, PhD) a Chairperson (Randy Otto, PhD, ABPP), and a liaison from APA Division 42 (Jeffrey Younggren, PhD, ABPP).\nThis document was revised in accordance with American Psychological Association Rule 30.08 and the APA policy document Criteria for the development and evaluation of practice guidelines (APA, 2001). The Committee posted announcements regarding the revision process to relevant electronic discussion lists and professional publications (i.e., Psylaw-L email listserve, American Academy of Forensic Psychology listserve, American Psychology-Law Society Newsletter).\nIn addition, an electronic discussion list devoted solely to issues concerning revision of the Guidelines was operated between December 2002 and July 2007, followed by establishment of an e-mail address in February 2008 (sgfp@yahoo.com). Individuals were invited to provide input and commentary on the existing Guidelines and proposed revisions via these means. In addition, two public meetings were held throughout the revision process at biennial meetings of the American Psychology-Law Society.\nUpon development of a draft that the Revisions Committee deemed suitable, the revised Guidelines were submitted for review to the Executive Committee of the American Psychology-Law Society and Division 41 of the American Psychological Association, and to the American Board of Forensic Psychology.\nOnce the revised Guidelines were approved by these two organizations, they were submitted to the American Psychological Association for review, commentary, and acceptance, consistent with the American Psychological Association’s Criteria for Practice Guideline Development and Evaluation (Committee on Professional Practice and Standards, 2001) and Rule 30-8. They were subsequently revised by the Revisions Committee and were adopted by the American Psychological Association Council of Representatives on [insert date here].\n\n\nDevelopers and Support\nThe Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology were developed by the American Psychology-Law Society (Division 41 of the American Psychological Association) and the American Academy of Forensic Psychology.\n\n\nCurrent Status\nThese Guidelines are scheduled to expire [insert date here]. After this date, users are encouraged to contact the American Psychological Association Practice Directorate to confirm that this document remains in effect.\nSGFP Guidelines originally adopted in 1991 (PDF, 64KB)\n Download \nJanuary 2006 Draft of the Revised SGFP Guidelines (PDF, 87KB)\n Download \nFebruary 2008 Draft of the Revised SGFP Guidelines (PDF, 99KB)\n Download \nSeptember 2008 Draft of the Revised SGFP Guidelines (PDF, 91KB)\n Download \nAugust 2010 Draft of the Revised SGFP Guidelines (PDF, 169KB)\n Download"

    "text": "9.01 Use of Appropriate Methods\nForensic practitioners strive to utilize appropriate methods and procedures in their work. When performing examinations, treatment, consultation, educational activities or scholarly investigations, forensic practitioners seek to maintain integrity by examining the issue or problem at hand from all reasonable perspectives and seek information that will differentially test plausible rival hypotheses.\n\n\n9.02 Use of Multiple Sources of Information\nForensic practitioners ordinarily avoid relying solely on one source of data, and corroborate important data whenever feasible (American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, in press). When relying upon data that have not been corroborated, forensic practitioners seek to make known the uncorroborated status of the data, any associated strengths and limitations, and the reasons for relying upon the data.\n\n\n9.03 Opinions Regarding Persons Not Examined\nForensic practitioners recognize their obligations to only provide written or oral evidence about the psychological characteristics of particular individuals when they have sufficient information or data to form an adequate foundation for those opinions or to substantiate their findings (EPPCC Standard 9.01). Forensic practitioners seek to make reasonable efforts to obtain such information or data, and they document their efforts to obtain it. When it is not possible or feasible to examine individuals about whom they are offering an opinion, forensic practitioners strive to make clear the impact of such limitations on the reliability and validity of their professional products, opinions, or testimony.\nWhen conducting a record review or providing consultation or supervision that does not warrant an individual examination, forensic practitioners seek to identify the sources of information on which they are basing their opinions and recommendations, including any substantial limitations to their opinions and recommendations."

    "section": "",
    "text": "3.01 Provision of Services\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to seek explicit agreements that define the scope of, time-frame of, and compensation for their services. In the event that a client breaches the contract or acts in a way that would require the practitioner to violate ethical, legal or professional obligations, the forensic practitioner may terminate the relationship.\nForensic practitioners strive to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in providing agreed-upon and reasonably anticipated services. Forensic practitioners are not bound, however, to provide services not reasonably anticipated when retained, nor to provide every possible aspect or variation of service. Instead, forensic practitioners may exercise professional discretion in determining the extent and means by which services are provided and agreements are fulfilled.\n\n\n3.02 Responsiveness\nForensic practitioners seek to manage their workloads so that services can be provided thoroughly, competently, and promptly. They recognize that acting with reasonable promptness, however, does not require the forensic practitioner to acquiesce to service demands not reasonably anticipated at the time the service was requested, nor does it require the forensic practitioner to provide services if the client has not acted in a manner consistent with existing agreements, including payment of fees.\n\n\n3.03 Communication\nForensic practitioners strive to keep their clients reasonably informed about the status of their services, comply with their clients’ reasonable requests for information, and consult with their clients about any substantial limitation on their conduct or performance that may arise when they reasonably believe that their clients expect a service that is not consistent with their professional obligations. Forensic practitioners attempt to keep their clients reasonably informed regarding new facts, opinions, or other potential evidence that may be relevant and applicable.\n\n\n3.04 Termination of Services\nThe forensic practitioner seeks to carry through to conclusion all matters undertaken for a client unless the forensic practitioner-client relationship is terminated. When a forensic practitioner’s employment is limited to a specific matter, the relationship may terminate when the matter has been resolved, anticipated services have been completed, or the agreement has been violated."

    "title": "Competence",
    "section": "",
    "text": "2.01 Scope of Competence\nWhen determining one’s competence to provide services in a particular matter, forensic practitioners may consider a variety of factors including the relative complexity and specialized nature of the service, relevant training and experience, the preparation and study they are able to devote to the matter, and the opportunity for consultation with a professional of established competence in the subject matter in question. Even with regard to subjects in which they are expert, forensic practitioners may choose to consult with colleagues.\n\n\n2.02 Gaining and Maintaining Competence\nCompetence can be acquired through various combinations of education, training, supervised experience, consultation, study, and professional experience. Forensic practitioners planning to provide services, teach, or conduct research involving populations, areas, techniques, or technologies that are new to them are encouraged to undertake relevant education, training, supervised experience, consultation, or study.\nForensic practitioners make ongoing efforts to develop and maintain their competencies (EPPCC Section 2.03). To maintain the requisite knowledge and skill, forensic practitioners keep abreast of developments in the fields of psychology and the law.\n\n\n2.03 Representing Competencies Consistent with the EPPCC\nForensic practitioners adequately and accurately inform all recipients of their services (e.g., attorneys, tribunals) about relevant aspects of the nature and extent of their experience, training, credentials, and qualifications, and how they were obtained (EPPCC Standard 5.01)\n\n\n2.04 Knowledge of the Legal System\nForensic practitioners recognize the importance of obtaining a fundamental and reasonable level of knowledge and understanding of the legal and professional standards, laws, rules, and precedents that govern their participation in legal proceedings and that guide the impact of their services on service recipients (EPPCC Standard 2.01).\nForensic practitioners aspire to manage their professional conduct in a manner that does not threaten or impair the rights of affected individuals. They may consult with, and refer others to, legal counsel on matters of law. Although they do not provide formal legal advice or opinions, forensic practitioners may provide information about the legal process to others based on their knowledge and experience. They strive to distinguish this from legal opinions, however, and encourage consultation with attorneys as appropriate.\n\n\n2.05 Knowledge of the Scientific Foundation for Opinions and Testimony\nForensic practitioners seek to provide opinions and testimony that are sufficiently based upon adequate scientific foundation, and reliable and valid principles and methods that have been applied appropriately to the facts of the case.\nWhen providing opinions and testimony that are based on novel or emerging principles and\nmethods, forensic practitioners seek to make known the status and limitations of these principles and methods.\n\n\n2.06 Knowledge of the Scientific Foundation for Teaching and Research\nForensic practitioners engage in teaching and research activities in which they have adequate knowledge, experience, and education (EPPCC Standard 2.01), and they acknowledge relevant limitations and caveats inherent in procedures and conclusions (EPPCC Standard 5.01).\n\n\n2.07 Considering the Impact of Personal Beliefs and Experience\nForensic practitioners recognize that their own cultures, attitudes, values, beliefs, opinions, or biases may affect their ability to practice in a competent and impartial manner. When such factors may diminish their ability to practice in a competent and impartial manner, forensic practitioners may take steps to correct or limit such effects, decline participation in the matter, or limit their participation in a manner that is consistent with professional obligations.\n\n\n2.08 Appreciation of Individual and Group Differences\nWhen scientific or professional knowledge in the discipline of psychology establishes that an understanding of factors associated with age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, language, socioeconomic status, or other relevant individual and cultural differences affects implementation or use of their services or research, forensic practitioners consider the boundaries of their expertise, make an appropriate referral if indicated, or gain the necessary training, experience, consultation, or supervision (EPPCC Standard 2.01, American Psychological Association, 2003; American Psychological Association, 2004; American Psychological Association, 2011c; American Psychological Association, in press; American Psychological Association Task Force on Guidelines for Assessment and Treatment of Persons with Disabilities, 2011).\nForensic practitioners strive to understand how factors associated with age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, language, socioeconomic status, or other relevant individual and cultural differences may affect and be related to the basis for people’s contact and involvement with the legal system.\nForensic practitioners do not engage in unfair discrimination based on such factors or on any basis proscribed by law (EPPCC Standard 3.01). They strive to take steps to correct or limit the effects of such factors on their work, decline participation in the matter, or limit their participation in a manner that is consistent with professional obligations.\n\n\n2.09 Appropriate Use of Services and Products\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to make reasonable efforts to guard against misuse of their services and exercise professional discretion in addressing such misuses."

    "text": "In the past 50 years forensic psychological practice had expanded dramatically. The American Psychological Association has a division devoted to matters of law and psychology (APA Division 41, the American Psychology-Law Society), a number of scientific journals devoted to interactions between psychology and the law exist (e.g., Law and Human Behavior, Psychology, Public Policy and Law, Behavioral Sciences and the Law), and a number of key texts have been published and undergone multiple revisions (e.g., Grisso, 1986, 2003; Melton, Petrila, Poythress, & Slobogin, 1987, 1997; Melton, Petrila, Poythress, Slobogin, Lyons, & Otto, 2007; Rogers, 1988, 1997, 2008).\nIn addition, training in forensic psychology is available in pre-doctoral, internship and post-doctoral settings, and the American Psychological Association recognized forensic psychology as a specialty in 2001, with subsequent re-certification in 2008.\nBecause the practice of forensic psychology differs in important ways from more traditional practice areas (Monahan, 1980) the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists were developed and published in 1991 (Committee on Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists, 1991). Because of continued developments in the field in the ensuing 20 years, forensic practitioners’ ongoing need for guidance, and policy requirements of the American Psychological Association, the 1991 Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists were revised, with the intent of benefiting forensic practitioners and recipients of their services alike.\nThe goals of these Guidelines are to improve the quality of forensic psychological services:\n\nenhance the practice and facilitate the systematic development of forensic psychology\nencourage a high level of quality in professional practice\nencourage forensic practitioners to acknowledge and respect the rights of those they serve\n\nThese Guidelines are intended for use by psychologists when engaged in the practice of forensic psychology as described below, and may also provide guidance on professional conduct to the legal system, and other organizations and professions.\nFor the purposes of these Guidelines, forensic psychology refers to professional practice by any psychologist working within any sub-discipline of psychology (e.g., clinical, developmental, social, cognitive) when applying the scientific, technical, or specialized knowledge of psychology to the law to assist in addressing legal, contractual, and administrative matters. Application of the Guidelines does not depend on the practitioner’s typical areas of practice or expertise, but rather on the service provided in the case at hand.\nThese Guidelines apply in all matters in which psychologists provide expertise to judicial, administrative, and educational systems including, but not limited to:\n\nexamining or treating persons in anticipation of or subsequent to legal, contractual, administrative, proceedings\noffering expert opinion about psychological issues in the form of amicus briefs or testimony to judicial, legislative or administrative bodies\nacting in an adjudicative capacity; serving as a trial consultant or otherwise offering expertise to attorneys, the courts, or others\nconducting research in connection with, or in the anticipation of, litigation\nor involvement in educational activities of a forensic nature\n\nPsychological practice is not considered forensic solely because the conduct takes place in, or the product is presented in, a tribunal or other judicial, legislative, or administrative forum.\n\nFor example, when a party (such as a civilly or criminally detained individual) or another individual (such as a child whose parents are involved in divorce proceedings) is ordered into treatment with a practitioner, that treatment is not necessarily the practice of forensic psychology. In addition, psychological testimony that is solely based on the provision of psychotherapy and does not include psycholegal opinions is not ordinarily considered forensic practice.\n\nFor the purposes of these Guidelines, “forensic practitioner” refers to a psychologist when engaged in the practice of forensic psychology as described above. Such professional conduct is considered forensic from the time the practitioner reasonably expects to, agrees to, or is legally mandated to, provide expertise on an explicitly psycholegal issue.\nThe provision of forensic services may include a wide variety of psycholegal roles and functions.\n\nFor example, as researchers, forensic practitioners may participate in the collection and dissemination of data that are relevant to various legal issues.\n\n\nAs advisors, forensic practitioners may provide an attorney with an informed understanding of the role that psychology can play in the case at hand.\n\n\nAs consultants, forensic practitioners may explain the practical implications of relevant research, examination findings, and the opinions of other psycholegal experts.\n\n\nAs examiners, forensic practitioners may assess an individual’s functioning and report findings and opinions to the attorney, a legal tribunal, an employer, an insurer, or others (American Psychological Association, 2010; American Psychological Association, 2011a).\n\n\nAs treatment providers, forensic practitioners may provide therapeutic services tailored to the issues and context of a legal proceeding.\n\n\nAs mediators or negotiators, forensic practitioners may serve in a third-party neutral role and assist parties in resolving disputes.\n\n\nAs arbiters, special masters, or case managers with decision-making authority, forensic practitioners may serve parties, attorneys, and the courts (American Psychological Association, 2011b).\n\nThese guidelines are informed by the American Psychological Association’s (APA’s) Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct (hereinafter referred to as the EPPCC; APA, 2002). The term guidelines refers to statements that suggest or recommend speciﬁc professional behavior, endeavors, or conduct for psychologists. Guidelines differ from standards in that standards are mandatory and may be accompanied by an enforcement mechanism. Guidelines are aspiration in intent. They are intended to facilitate the continued systematic development of the profession and facilitate a high level of practice by psychologists. Guidelines are not intended to be mandatory or exhaustive and may not be applicable to every professional situation. They are not deﬁnitive, and they are not intended to take precedence over the judgment of psychologists.\nAs such, the Guidelines are advisory in areas in which the forensic practitioner has discretion to exercise professional judgment that is not prohibited or mandated by the EPPCC or applicable law, rules, or regulations. The Guidelines neither add obligations to nor eliminate obligations from the EPPCC, but provide additional guidance for psychologists. The modifiers used in the Guidelines (e.g., reasonably, appropriate, potentially) are included in recognition of the need for professional judgment on the part of forensic practitioners; ensure applicability across the broad range of activities conducted by forensic practitioners; and reduce the likelihood of enacting an inflexible set of guidelines that might be inapplicable as forensic practice evolves. The use of these modifiers, and the recognition of the role of professional discretion and judgment, also reflects that forensic practitioners are likely to encounter facts and circumstances not anticipated by the Guidelines and they may have to act upon uncertain or incomplete evidence. The Guidelines may provide general or conceptual guidance in such circumstances. The Guidelines do not, however, exhaust the legal, professional, moral and ethical considerations that inform forensic practitioners, for no complex activity can be completely defined by legal rules, codes of conduct, and aspirational guidelines.\nThe Guidelines are not intended to serve as a basis for disciplinary action or civil or criminal liability. The standard of care is established by a competent authority not by the Guidelines. No ethical, licensure, or other administrative action or remedy, nor any other cause of action, should be taken solely on the basis of a forensic practitioner acting in a manner consistent or inconsistent with these Guidelines.\nIn cases in which a competent authority references the Guidelines when formulating standards, the authority should consider that the Guidelines attempt to identify a high level of quality in forensic practice. Competent practice is defined as the conduct of a reasonably prudent forensic practitioner engaged in similar activities in similar circumstances. Professional conduct evolves and may be viewed along a continuum of adequacy, and “minimally competent” and “best possible” are usually different points along that continuum.\nThe Guidelines are designed to be national in scope and are intended to be consistent with state and federal law. In cases in which a conflict between legal and professional obligations occur, forensic practitioners make known their commitment to the EPPCC and the Guidelines and take steps to achieve an appropriate resolution consistent with the EPPCC and Guidelines.\nThe format of the Guidelines is different from most other practice guidelines developed under the auspices of APA. This reflects the history of the Guidelines as well as the fact that the Guidelines are considerably broader in scope than any other APA-developed guidelines. Indeed, these are the only APA-approved guidelines that address a complete specialty practice area. Despite this difference in format, the Guidelines function as all other APA guideline documents.\nThis  document  replaces the 1991 Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists which were approved by the American Psychology-Law Society, Division 41 of the American Psychological Association and the American Board of Forensic Psychology. The current revision has also been approved by the Council of Representatives of the American Psychological Association. Appendix I includes a discussion of the revision process, enactment, and current status of these Guidelines. Appendix II includes definitions and terminology as used for the purposes of these Guidelines."

    "text": "10.01 Focus on Legally Relevant Factors\nForensic examiners seek to assist the trier of fact to understand evidence or determine a fact in issue, and they provide information that is most relevant to the psycholegal issue. In reports and testimony forensic practitioners typically provide information about examinees’ functional abilities, capacities, knowledge, and beliefs, and address their opinions and recommendations to the identified psycholegal issues (American Bar Association and American Psychological Assocation, 2008; Grisso, 1986, 2003; Heilbrun, Marczyk, DeMatteo, & Mack-Allen, 2007).\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to consider the problems that may arise by using a clinical diagnosis in some forensic contexts, and consider and qualify their opinions and testimony appropriately.\n\n\n10.02 Selection and Use of Assessment Procedures\nForensic practitioners use assessment procedures in the manner and for the purposes that are appropriate in light of the research on or evidence of their usefulness and proper application (EPPCC Standard 9.02, American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, in press9). This includes assessment techniques, interviews, tests, instruments, and other procedures and their administration, adaptation, scoring, and interpretation, including computerized scoring and interpretation systems.\nForensic practitioners use assessment instruments whose validity and reliability have been established for use with members of the population assessed. When such validity and reliability have not been established, forensic practitioners consider and describe the strengths and limitations of their findings. Forensic practitioners use assessment methods that are appropriate to an examinee’s language preference and competence, unless the use of an alternative language is relevant to the assessment issues (EPPCC Standard 9.02).\nAssessment in forensic contexts differs from assessment in therapeutic contexts in important ways that forensic practitioners strive to take into account when conducting forensic examinations. Forensic practitioners seek to consider the strengths and limitations of employing traditional assessment procedures in forensic examinations (American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, in press). Given the stakes involved in forensic contexts, forensic practitioners strive to ensure the integrity and security of test materials and results (American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, in press9).\nWhen the validity of an assessment technique has not been established in the forensic context or setting in which it is being used, the forensic practitioner seeks to describe the strengths and limitations of any test results and explain the extrapolation of these data to the forensic context Because of the many differences between forensic and therapeutic contexts, forensic practitioners consider and seek to make known that some examination results may warrant substantially different interpretation when administered in forensic contexts (American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, in press).\nForensic practitioners consider and seek to make known that forensic examination results can be affected by factors unique to, or differentially present in, forensic contexts including response style, voluntariness of participation, and situational stress associated with involvement in forensic or legal matters (American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, in press).\n\n\n10.03 Appreciation of Individual Differences\nWhen interpreting assessment results forensic practitioners consider the purpose of the assessment as well as the various test factors, test-taking abilities, and other characteristics of the person being assessed, such as situational, personal, linguistic, and cultural differences that might affect their judgments or reduce the accuracy of their interpretations (EPPCC Standard 9.06). Forensic practitioners strive to identify any significant strengths and limitations of their procedures and interpretations.\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to consider how the assessment process may be impacted by any disability an examinee is experiencing, make accommodations as possible, and consider such when interpreting and communicating the results of the assessment (American Psychological Association Task Force on Guidelines for Assessment and treatment of Persons with Disabilities, 2011).\n\n\n10.04 Consideration of Assessment Settings\nIn order to maximize the validity of assessment results, forensic practitioners strive to conduct evaluations in settings that provide adequate comfort, safety and privacy.\n\n\n10.05 Provision of Assessment Feedback\nForensic practitioners take reasonable steps to explain assessment results to the examinee or a designated representative in language they can understand (EPPCC Standard 9.10). In those circumstances in which communication about assessment results is precluded, the forensic practitioner explains this to the examinee in advance (EPPCC Standard 9.10).\nForensic practitioners seek to provide information about professional work in a manner consistent with professional and legal standards for the disclosure of test data or results, interpretation of data, and the factual bases for conclusions.\n\n\n10.06 Documentation and Compilation of Data Considered\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to recognize the importance of documenting all data they consider with enough detail and quality to allow for reasonable judicial scrutiny and adequate discovery by all parties. This documentation includes, but is not limited to, letters and consultations; notes, recordings, and transcriptions; assessment and test data, scoring reports and interpretations; and all other records in any form or medium that were created or exchanged in connection with a matter.\nWhen contemplating third party observation or audio/video-recording of examinations forensic practitioners strive to consider any law that may control such matters, the need for transparency and documentation, and the potential impact of observation or recording on the validity of the examination and test security (American Psychological Association Committee on Psychological Tests and Assessment, 2007).\n\n\n10.07 Provision of Documentation\nPursuant to proper subpoenas or court orders, or other legally proper consent from authorized persons, forensic practitioners seek to make available all documentation described in 10.05, all financial records related to the matter, and any other records including reports (and draft reports if they have been provided to a party, attorney, or other entity for review), that might reasonably be related to the opinions to be expressed.\n\n\n10.08 Recordkeeping\nForensic practitioners establish and maintain a system of recordkeeping and professional communication (EPPCC Standard 6.01; American Psychological Association, 2007), and attend to relevant laws and rules. When indicated by the extent of the rights, liberties, and properties that may be at risk, the complexity of the case, the amount and legal significance of unique evidence in the care and control of the forensic practitioner, and the likelihood of future appeal, forensic practitioners strive to inform the retaining party of the limits of recordkeeping times. If requested to do so, forensic practitioners consider maintaining such records until notified that all appeals in the matter have been exhausted, or sending a copy of any unique components/aspects of the record in their care and control to the retaining party before destruction of the record."

    "text": "Forensic practitioners recognize their ethical obligations to maintain the confidentiality of information relating to a client or retaining party, except insofar as disclosure is consented to by the client or retaining party, or required or permitted by law (EPPCC Standard 4.01).\n\n\n8.01 Release of Information\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to recognize the importance of complying with properly noticed and served subpoenas or court orders directing release of information, or other legally proper consent from duly authorized persons, unless there is a legally valid reason to offer an objection. When in doubt about an appropriate response or course of action, forensic practitioners may seek assistance from the retaining client, retain and seek legal advice from their own attorney, or formally notify the drafter of the subpoena or order of their uncertainty.\n\n\n8.02 Access to Information\nIf requested, forensic practitioners seek to provide the retaining party access to, and a meaningful explanation of, all information that is in their records for the matter at hand, consistent with the relevant law, applicable codes of ethics and professional standards, and institutional rules and regulations. Forensic examinees typically are not provided access to the forensic practitioner’s records without the consent of the retaining party. Access to records by anyone other than the retaining party is governed by legal process, usually subpoena or court order, or by explicit consent of the retaining party. Forensic practitioners may charge a reasonable fee for the costs associated with the storage, reproduction, review, and provision of records.\n\n\n8.03 Acquiring Collateral and Third Party Information\nForensic practitioners strive to access information or records from collateral sources with the consent of the relevant attorney or the relevant party, or when otherwise authorized by law or court order.\n\n\n8.04 Use of Case Materials in Teaching, Continuing Education, and Other Scholarly Activities\nForensic practitioners using case materials for purposes of teaching, training, or research strive to present such information in a fair, balanced, and respectful manner. They attempt to protect the privacy of persons by disguising the confidential, personally identifiable information of all persons and entities who would reasonably claim a privacy interest; using only those aspects of the case available in the public domain; or obtaining consent from the relevant clients, parties, participants, and organizations to use the materials for such purposes (EPPCC Standard 4.07; also see Sections 11.06 and 11.07 of these guidelines)."

    "text": "In forensic psychology practice conflicting responsibilities and demands may be encountered. When conflicts occur, forensic practitioners seek to make the conflict known to the relevant parties or agencies, and consider the rights and interests of the relevant parties or agencies in their attempts to resolve the conflict.\n\n\n7.01 Conflicts with Legal Authority\nWhen their responsibilities conflict with law, regulations, or other governing legal authority, forensic practitioners make known their commitment to the EPPCC, and take steps to resolve the conflict. In situations in which the EPPCC or Guidelines are in conflict with the law, attempts to resolve the conflict are made in accordance with the EPPCC (EPPCC Standard 1.02).\nWhen the conflict cannot be resolved by such means, forensic practitioners may adhere to the requirements of the law, regulations, or other governing legal authority, but only to the extent required and not in any way that violates a person’s human rights (EPPCC Standard 1.03).\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to consider the appropriateness of complying with court orders when such compliance creates potential conflicts with professional standards of practice.\n\n\n7.02 Conflicts with Organizational Demands\nWhen the demands of an organization with which they are affiliated or for whom they are working conflict with their professional responsibilities and obligations, forensic practitioners strive to clarify the nature of the conflict and, to the extent feasible, resolve the conflict in a way consistent with professional obligations and responsibilities (EPPCC Standard 1.03).\n\n\n7.03 Resolving Ethical Issues with Fellow Professionals\nWhen an apparent or potential ethical violation has caused, or is likely to cause, substantial harm, forensic practitioners are encouraged to take action appropriate to the situation and consider a number of factors including the nature and the immediacy of the potential harm; applicable privacy, confidentiality, and privilege; how the rights of the relevant parties may be affected by a particular course of action; and any other legal or ethical obligations (EPPCC Standard 1.04). Steps to resolve perceived ethical conflicts may include, but are not be limited to, obtaining the consultation of knowledgeable colleagues, obtaining the advice of independent counsel, and conferring directly with the client.\nWhen forensic practitioners believe there may have been an ethical violation by another professional, an attempt is made to resolve the issue by bringing it to the attention of that individual, if that attempt does not violate any rights or privileges that may be involved, and if an informal resolution appears appropriate (EPPCC Standard 1.04). If this does not result in a satisfactory resolution, the forensic practitioner may have to take further action appropriate to the situation, including making a report to third parties of the perceived ethical violation (EPPCC Standard 1.05). In most instances, in order to minimize unforeseen risks to the party’s rights in the legal matter, forensic practitioners consider consulting with the client before attempting to resolve a perceived ethical violation with another professional."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Whether a forensic practitioner-client relationship exists depends on the circumstances and is determined by a number of factors which may include the information exchanged between the potential client and the forensic practitioner prior to, or at the initiation of, any contact or service, the nature of the interaction, and the purpose of the interaction.\nIn their work, forensic practitioners recognize that relationships are established with those who retain their services (e.g., retaining parties, employers, insurers, the court) and those with whom they interact (e.g., examinees, collateral contacts, research participants, students). Forensic practitioners recognize that associated obligations and duties vary as a function of the nature of the relationship.\n4.01 Responsibilities to Retaining Parties Most responsibilities to the retaining party attach only after the retaining party has requested and the forensic practitioner has agreed to render professional services and an agreement regarding compensation has been reached. Forensic practitioners are aware that there are some responsibilities, such as privacy, confidentiality, and privilege that may attach when the forensic practitioner agrees to consider whether a forensic practitioner-retaining party relationship shall be established. Forensic practitioners, prior to entering into a contract, may direct the potential retaining party not to reveal any confidential or privileged information as a way of protecting the retaining party’s interest in case a conflict exists as a result of pre-existing relationships.\nAt the initiation of any request for service, forensic practitioners seek to clarify the nature of the relationship and the services to be provided including the role of the forensic practitioner (e.g., trial consultant, forensic examiner, treatment provider, expert witness, research consultant); which person or entity is the client; the probable uses of the services provided or information obtained; and any limitations to privacy, confidentiality, or privilege.\n4.02 Multiple Relationships A multiple relationship occurs when a forensic practitioner is in a professional role with a person and, at the same time or at a subsequent time, is in a different role with the same person; is involved in a personal, fiscal, or other relationship with an adverse party; at the same time is in a relationship with a person closely associated with or related to the person with whom the forensic practitioner has the professional relationship; or offers or agrees to enter into another relationship in the future with the person or a person closely associated with or related to the person (EPPCC Standard 3.05).\nForensic practitioners strive to recognize the potential conflicts of interest and threats to objectivity inherent in multiple relationships. Forensic practitioners are encouraged to recognize that some personal and professional relationships may interfere with their ability to practice in a competent and impartial manner and they seek to minimize any detrimental effects by avoiding involvement in such matters whenever feasible or limiting their assistance in a manner that is consistent with professional obligations.\n4.02.01 Therapeutic-Forensic Role Conflicts Providing forensic and therapeutic psychological services to the same individual or closely related individuals involves multiple relationships that may impair objectivity and/or cause exploitation or other harm. Therefore, when requested or ordered to provide either concurrent or sequential forensic and therapeutic services, forensic practitioners are encouraged to disclose the potential risk and make reasonable efforts to refer the request to another qualified provider. If referral is not possible, the forensic practitioner is encouraged to consider the risks and benefits to all parties and to the legal system or entity likely to be impacted, the possibility of separating each service widely in time, seeking judicial review and direction, and consulting with knowledgeable colleagues. When providing both forensic and therapeutic services, forensic practitioners seek to minimize the potential negative effects of this circumstance (EPPCC Standard 3.05).\n4.02.02 Expert Testimony by Practitioners Providing Therapeutic Services Providing expert testimony about a patient who is a participant in a legal matter does not necessarily involve the practice of forensic psychology even when that testimony is relevant to a psycholegal issue before the decision-maker. For example, providing testimony on matters such as a patient’s reported history or other statements, mental status, diagnosis, progress, prognosis, and treatment would not ordinarily be considered forensic practice even when the testimony is related to a psycholegal issue before the decision-maker. In contrast, rendering opinions and providing testimony about a person on psycholegal issues (e.g., criminal responsibility, legal causation, proximate cause, trial competence, testamentary capacity, the relative merits of parenting arrangements) would ordinarily be considered the practice of forensic psychology.\nConsistent with their ethical obligations to base their opinions on information and techniques sufficient to substantiate their findings (EPPCC Standards 2.04, 9.01), forensic practitioners are encouraged to provide testimony only on those issues for which they have adequate foundation and only when a reasonable forensic practitioner engaged in similar circumstances would determine that the ability to make a proper decision is unlikely to be impaired. As with testimony regarding forensic examinees, the forensic practitioner strives to identify any substantive limitations that may affect the reliability and validity of the facts or opinions offered, and communicates these to the decision maker.\n4.02.03 Provision of Forensic Therapeutic Services Although some therapeutic services can be considered forensic in nature, the fact that therapeutic services are ordered by the court does not necessarily make them forensic.\nIn determining whether a therapeutic service should be considered the practice of forensic psychology, psychologists are encouraged to consider the potential impact of the legal context on treatment, the potential for treatment to impact the psycholegal issues involved in the case, and whether another reasonable psychologist in a similar position would consider the service to be forensic and these Guidelines to be applicable.\nTherapeutic services can have significant effects on current or future legal proceedings. Forensic practitioners are encouraged to consider these effects and minimize any unintended or negative effects on such proceedings or therapy when they provide therapeutic services in forensic contexts.\n4.03 Provision of Emergency Mental Health Services to Forensic Examinees When providing forensic examination services an emergency may arise that requires the practitioner to provide short term therapeutic services to the examinee in order to prevent imminent harm to the examinee or others. In such cases, the forensic practitioner is encouraged to limit disclosure of information and inform the retaining attorney, legal representative, or the court in an appropriate manner. Upon providing emergency treatment to examinees, forensic practitioners consider whether they can continue in a forensic role with that individual so that potential for harm to the recipient of services is avoided (EPPCC 3.04)."

    "text": "Because substantial rights, liberties, and properties are often at risk in forensic matters, and because the methods and procedures of forensic practitioners are complex and may not be accurately anticipated by the recipients of forensic services, forensic practitioners strive to inform service recipients about the nature and parameters of the services to be provided (EPPCC Standards 3.04, 3.10).\n\n\n6.01 Timing and Substance\nForensic practitioners strive to inform clients, examinees, and others who are the recipients of forensic services as soon as is feasible about the nature and extent of reasonably anticipated forensic services.\nIn determining what information to impart, forensic practitioners are encouraged to consider a variety of factors including the person’s experience or training in psychological and legal matters of the type involved and whether the person is represented by counsel. When questions or uncertainties remain after they have made the effort to explain the necessary information, forensic practitioners may recommend that the person seek legal advice.\n\n\n6.02 Communication with Those Seeking to Retain a Forensic Practitioner\nAs part of the initial process of being retained, or as soon thereafter as previously unknown information becomes available, forensic practitioners strive to disclose to the retaining party information that would reasonably be anticipated to affect a decision to retain or continue the services of the forensic practitioner.\nThis disclosure may include, but is not limited to, the fee structure for anticipated services; prior and current personal or professional activities, obligations and relationships that would reasonably lead to the fact or the appearance of a conflict of interest; the forensic practitioner’s knowledge, skill, experience, and education relevant to the forensic services being considered, including any significant limitations; and the scientific bases and limitations of the methods and procedures which are expected to be employed.\n\n\n6.03 Communication with Forensic Examinees\nForensic practitioners inform examinees about the nature and purpose of the examination (EPPCC Standard 9.03; American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, 1999). Such information may include the purpose, nature, and anticipated use of the examination; who will have access to the information; associated limitations on privacy, confidentiality, and privilege including who is authorized to release or access the information contained in the forensic practitioner’s records; the voluntary or involuntary nature of participation, including potential consequences of participation or non-participation, if known; and, if the cost of the service is the responsibility of the examinee, the anticipated cost.\n\n\n6.03.01 Persons Not Ordered or Mandated to Undergo Examination\nIf the examinee is not ordered by the court to participate in a forensic examination, the forensic practitioner seeks his or her informed consent (EPPCC Standards 3.10, 9.03). If the examinee declines to proceed after being notified of the nature and purpose of the forensic examination, the forensic practitioner may consider postponing the examination, advising the examinee to contact his or her attorney, and notifying the retaining party about the examinee’s unwillingness to proceed.\n\n\n6.03.02 Persons Ordered or Mandated to Undergo Examination or Treatment\nIf the examinee is ordered by the court to participate, the forensic practitioner can conduct the examination over the objection, and without the consent, of the examinee (EPPCC Standards 3.10, 9.03). If the examinee declines to proceed after being notified of the nature and purpose of the forensic examination, the forensic practitioner may consider a variety of options including postponing the examination, advising the examinee to contact his or her attorney, and notifying the retaining party about the examinee’s unwillingness to proceed.\nWhen an individual is ordered to undergo treatment but the goals of treatment are determined by a legal authority rather than the individual receiving services, the forensic practitioner informs the service recipient of the nature and purpose of treatment, and any limitations on confidentiality and privilege (EPPCC Standards 3.10, 10.01).\n\n\n6.03.03 Persons Lacking Capacity to Provide Informed Consent\nForensic practitioners appreciate that the very conditions that precipitate psychological examination of individuals involved in legal proceedings can impair their functioning in a variety of important ways, including their ability to understand and consent to the evaluation process.\nFor examinees adjudicated or presumed by law to lack the capacity to provide informed consent for the anticipated forensic service, the forensic practitioner nevertheless provides an appropriate explanation, seeks the examinee’s assent, and obtain appropriate permission from a legally authorized person, as permitted or required by law (EPPCC Standards 3.10, 9.03).\nFor examinees whom the forensic practitioner has concluded lack capacity to provide informed consent to a proposed, non-court-ordered service, but who have not been adjudicated as lacking such capacity, the forensic practitioner strives to take reasonable steps to protect their rights and welfare (EPPCC Standard 3.10). In such cases, the forensic practitioner may consider suspending the proposed service or notifying the examinee’s attorney or the retaining party.\n\n\n6.03.04 Evaluation of Persons Not Represented by Counsel\nBecause of the significant rights that may be at issue in a legal proceeding, forensic practitioners carefully consider the appropriateness of conducting a forensic evaluation of an individual who is not represented by counsel. Forensic practitioners may consider conducting such evaluations or delaying the evaluation so as to provide the examinee with the opportunity to consult with counsel.\n\n\n6.04 Communication with Collateral Sources of Information\nForensic practitioners disclose to potential collateral sources information that might reasonably be expected to inform their decisions about participating that may include, but may not be limited to, who has retained the forensic practitioner; the nature, purpose, and intended use of the examination or other procedure; the nature of and any limits on privacy, confidentiality, and privilege; and whether their participation is voluntary (EPPCC Standard 3.10).\n\n\n6.05 Communication in Research Contexts\nWhen engaging in research or scholarly activities conducted as a service to a client in a legal proceeding, forensic practitioners attempt to clarify any anticipated use of the research or scholarly product, disclose their role in the resulting research or scholarly products, and obtain whatever consent or agreement is required.\nIn advance of any scientific study, forensic practitioners seek to negotiate with the client the circumstances under and manner in which the results may be made known to others. Forensic practitioners strive to balance the potentially competing rights and interests of the retaining party with the inappropriateness of suppressing data, for example, by agreeing to report the data without identifying the jurisdiction in which the study took place. Forensic practitioners represent the results of research in an accurate manner (EPPCC Standard 5.01)."

Practitioners are in a unique position to offer education, assessment, intervention, and advocacy on issues of REC disparities, racism, and discrimination in the field of psychology and the law. However, a limited body of research, lack of practice guidelines on REC integration in forensic practice, and low representation of Black, Indigenous, People Of Color (BIPOC) professionals, limit such efforts. Mentorship of emerging practitioners in psychology and the law on such issues can bridge the gap of knowledge, application, and BIPOC representation in the field.\n\n\n\n\nThe AP-LS Practice Committee wants to recognize the substantive contributions of practitioner mentors who educate and support emerging clinicians in psychology and the law with a lens toward the elimination of REC disparities and social justice. For these purposes, we use Goldstein’s (2007) definition of the practice of psychology and the law: “The application of psychological research, theory, practice, and traditional and specialized methodology (e.g. interviewing, psychological testing, forensic assessment, and forensically relevant instruments) to provide information relevant to a legal question.”\n\n\n\n\nThe award for Outstanding Practitioner Mentoring to Eliminate Racial, Ethnic, and Cultural (REC) Disparities in the Field of Psychology and the Law, will be conferred on a yearly basis. The Recipient will receive a $500.00 cash award, a plaque to be presented at the annual AP-LS conference and will be featured in an AP-LS newsletter article, written by the practice committee, highlighting the recipient’s achievements and recommendations to other practitioners. Highlighting the recipient's mentorship practices and experiences can serve as a model for other professionals in the field of psychology and the law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Publications and Communications (P&C) Board of the American Psychological Association has opened nominations for the editorships of Clinician’s Research Digest, Psychology, Public Policy, and Law, Psychology and Aging, Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory and Cognition, and the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Interpersonal Relations and Group Processes. Marisol Perez, PhD, Michael Lamb, PhD, Elizabeth A.L. Stine-Morrow, PhD, Kathi A. Borden, PhD, Aaron S.

As part of the BRIDGE Committee initiative to increase diversity within AP-LS, and the profession as a whole, these award programs support research for undergraduate and graduate students. Please take a few minutes to review the program descriptions below and consider if you or any students you know might be eligible, and encourage them to apply. Also, please feel free to forward this information to any colleagues who might be interested in these award programs. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15, 2022 through January 15, 2023. Recipients will be announced in February 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit Award Applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Access Path to Psychology and Law Experience (AP) Program is to increase diversity within psychology and law by increasing the pipeline of competitive graduate school applicants from groups that currently are underrepresented in the field, including racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and disabled students. AP is designed to encourage faculty members to recruit students from underrepresented groups into their research labs. It provides financial support for the students to obtain meaningful research experience and attend the AP-LS conference as well as other opportunities for mentoring and development. It is the intention of the BRIDGE Committee that many of the students in the AP program will apply for graduate training related to psychology and law and ultimately become professionals in the field. The AP program primarily targets undergraduate students, but students from terminal master’s degree programs will also be considered. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15, 2022 through January 15, 2023. Recipients will be announced in February 2023.\n\n\n For more information about the AP Program, please contact the program Chair, Dr. Jason Lawrence at jason.lawrence@dmh.mo.gov.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit Award Applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Diversity in Psychology and Law Research Awards is to promote diversity within the American Psychology-Law Society by supporting student research on psycholegal issues related to diversity as well as research by students from underrepresented groups. Projects are eligible for consideration for this award if (1) they investigate topics related to psychology, law, diversity, and/or multiculturalism (e.g., research pertaining to psycholegal issues on race, gender, culture, sexual orientation, etc.) or (2) if the principal investigator is a member of an underrepresented group, including racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and students with disabilities. Consistent with the mission of the BRIDGE Committee, these awards are intended to facilitate the research of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in AP-LS, as well as research about issues of potential interest and importance to such groups. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15th, 2022 through January15, 2023. Recipients will be announced in February 2023.\n\n\n For more information about the Diversity Program, please contact the program Chair, Dr. Evelyn Maeder at evelyn.maeder@carlton.ca.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit Award Applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of an initiative to increase diversity within AP-LS, the Minority Affairs Committee will provide travel awards to students from underrepresented groups (i.e., racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and students with disabilities) who are presenting research at the American Psychology-Law Society Conference.

It is important that you vote by December 15 to keep AP-LS's voice heard at APA.\n\n\n\n\nThe ballot includes votes on changes to the APA bylaws and an apportionment ballot which determines how many voting members AP-LS gets on APA's governing body, the Council of Representatives (Council). In the past year, your AP-LS representatives (Jason Cantone and Margaret Bull Kovera) have co-written legislation on the interrogation of criminal suspects, removal of felony status questions on psychological association applications, the creation of a Council ombuds, and removal of mental health treatment questions from bar exam character and fitness examinations, as well as legislation to improve the APA policymaking process.\n\n\n\n\nApportionment votes determine how many representatives AP-LS can send to APA Council. With more Council Representatives, we can better call attention to issues dear to our members and have a greater influence on APA policy. In the past few years, AP-LS has been very close to gaining a third representative! To get that third representative, we need each APA member to give all 10 of their apportionment votes to Division 41/AP-LS. Please make sure to vote! If you did not receive an e-mail ballot, please contact APA at elections@apa.org.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are accepting submissions for the 2022 Dissertation Award Competition. Each year, the AP-LS Dissertation Committee selects First, Second, and Third Place winners of the AP-LS Dissertation Award for outstanding dissertation research involving basic or applied research in psychology and law. Recipients receive a monetary award and will be invited to present their dissertation work at the 2023 AP-LS Conference. AP-LS members who defend their dissertation during the 2022 calendar year are eligible to apply.

Long-standing issues such as prison over-crowding, limited financial resources, geographical remoteness, low staff recruitment and retention, safety and security constraints, and traditional administrative values that favor punishment over rehabilitation can stifle the implementation of more innovative and progressive efforts. However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing calls from advocacy groups, politicians, and the general public have placed pressures on correctional systems to explore alternative solutions that balance crime reduction with humane care and common sense policies. As jails and prisons continue to serve as major mental health providers, innovations specific to psychological interventions are especially relevant.\n\n\n\n\nThis special section will highlight emerging issues and inventive trends in correctional psychology research and practice that can inform policy decisions and reform efforts. Original quantitative and/or qualitative research is strongly encouraged; however, empirically grounded systematic reviews or policy/practice recommendations will also be considered. Manuscripts focused on all areas of corrections are welcome, but topics of particular interest include:\n\n\n\nTechnological advances that improve access to and delivery of correctional practices or policy implementation\n\n\nIntegrating social justice principles in assessment and intervention for clients in correctional settings\n\n\nMental and behavioral health responses to COVID-19 in correctional settings o Creative approaches to addressing and reducing the jail-based competency crisis\n\n\nValidation of novel and feasible suicide and violence risk instruments with correctional samples\n\n\nMedication assisted treatment and other innovative substance use interventions\n\n\nAdaptation or development of evidence-based assessment or interventions for underserved and understudied populations (e.g., people with neurodevelopmental disorders, women and non-binary people, LGBTQIA+ persons, people of color, etc.)\n\n\nUnique methodological or statistical approaches to conducting correctional research or evaluating the effectiveness of new policies\n\n\n\nFor general inquiries, prospective contributors may contact Dr. Ashley Batastini at Ashley.batastini@memphis.edu. Manuscripts must be submitted through the journal’s online submission portal in accordance with specified formatting guidelines. Once in the portal, there will be a drop-down option to designate your submission for consideration in this special section. Deadline for submissions is March 15, 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you always wondered how people get to be reviewers for prestigious journals? Are you interested in becoming a reviewer for Law and Human Behavior, the official journal of AP-LS, but don’t know what that means or how to get training and experience with providing strong reviews? Do you have limited or no access to a mentor that can help provide this type of experience?\n\n\n\n\nIf so, now is your chance to develop your reviewer skills! The LHB editorial team is continuing their Reviewer Mentoring Program in 2023. The program will kick off at the AP-LS Conference in Philadelphia with an in-person training and will continue throughout the rest of the year. The program is designed to provide advanced graduate students (in 3rd, 4th or 5th years of study) and ECPs (within 10 years of last terminal degree) with training and mentoring specifically in conducting strong peer reviews.\n\n\n\n\nWe will be selecting a small group of Reviewers to participate in the workshop in March 2023, and we will match those participants with Reviewer Mentors. Mentees will be assigned 1-2 manuscripts to review throughout 2023, under the guidance of their Reviewer Mentor.\n\n\n\n\nIf you would like to be considered for this program, please complete the application by December 31, 2022. If you have questions about the program, please contact our Associate Editor, Jenni Cox at jennifer.m.cox@ua.edu or Editor in Chief, Bradley McAuliff at bradley.mcauliff@csun.edu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply Today\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Leah Georges has stepped down as Associate Editor of the newsletter.

Although there was a decline in the number of votes cast by APA members for Division 41 in the 2024 apportionment process, we did maintain our two Council of Representative seats. To maintain these two Division 41 seats on Council, it will be important for those APLS members who are also APA members to cast more of their votes for Division 41 in the next apportionment vote.\n \nOutcome of Voting on Amendments to APA Bylaws\nAll three of the most recently proposed amendments to the APA bylaws were approved by the membership (proportion of voting members approving in parentheses below).\n \n\nAmendment #1 – Update Mission of Membership Board to be in Alignment with Current Practices  (84.05%)\nAmendment #2 – Association Members Gain Voting Privileges After One Year Instead of Five Years (73.33%)\nAmendment #3 – Add a Graduate Student member on the Board for the Advancement of Psychology in the Public Interest, Board of Convention Affairs, Board of Educational Affairs, Board of Professional Affairs, Board of Scientific Affairs, Membership Board and Policy and Planning Board (82.28%)\n\n \nLeadership Opportunities & Fellowships\nAPA seeks nominations (including self-nominations) for its many boards and committees. We strongly encourage you to review the openings and nomination instructions. This is a great way to gain leadership experience and to get the voice of AP-LS heard within APA governance. You need to be an APA member to serve on an APA board or committee. Nominations are due January 31. Election slates are then developed and the APA Board of Directors approves the slates by mid-April. APA Council members then vote in Fall 2023. Additional questions can be directed to the APA Election Office at elections@apa.org. \n \nAPA also seeks nominees for the APA Congressional Fellowship program and APA Executive Branch Science Fellowship. Applications are due January 30. \n \nStandards of Accreditation for Master's Degree Programs\nAPA seeks public comments on Implementing Regulations related to the Standards of Accreditation for Health Service Psychology, Master’s Degree Programs, which outline education and training requirements for the accreditation of health service psychology programs at the master’s level. Information about the proposed standards and public comment is available on their website. Comments are due by February 2, 2023. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAP-LS 2023 Submission Decisions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecisions regarding AP-LS 2023 conference submissions have been published.

Practitioners are in a unique position to offer education, assessment, intervention and advocacy on issues of REC disparities, racism, and discrimination in the field of psychology and the law. However, a limited body of research, lack of practice guidelines on REC integration in forensic practice, and low representation of Black, Indigenous, People Of Color (BIPOC) professionals, limit such efforts. Mentorship of emerging practitioners in psychology and the law on such issues can bridge the gap of knowledge, application, and BIPOC representation in the field.  \n \nThe AP-LS Practice Committee wants to recognize the substantive contributions of practitioner mentors who educate and support emerging clinicians in psychology and the law with a lens toward the elimination of REC disparities and social justice. For these purposes, we use Goldstein’s (2007) definition of the practice of psychology and the law: “The application of psychological research, theory, practice, and traditional and specialized methodology (e.g.  interviewing, psychological testing, forensic assessment, and forensically relevant instruments) to provide information relevant to a legal question.”  \n \nThe award for Outstanding Practitioner Mentoring to Eliminate Racial, Ethnic and Cultural (REC) Disparities in the Field of Psychology and the Law, will be conferred on a yearly basis. The Recipient will receive a $500.00 cash award, a plaque to be presented at the annual AP-LS conference and will be featured in an AP-LS newsletter article, written by the practice committee, highlighting the recipient’s achievements and recommendations to other practitioners. Highlighting the recipient's mentorship practices and experiences can serve as a model for other professionals in the field of psychology and the law.  \n\nNomination packages are due January 15, 2023 and should be emailed to the chair of the award subcommittee, Dr. Lara Guzmán-Hosta at lguzman.hosta@gmail.com.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBRIDGE Committee Award Programs\nCall for Applications 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AP-LS Broadening Representation Inclusion, Diversity, and Global Equity or BRIDGE Committee is seeking applicants for two award programs. As part of the BRIDGE Committee initiative to increase diversity within AP-LS, and the profession as a whole, these award programs support research for undergraduate and graduate students. Please take a few minutes to review the program descriptions below and consider if you or any students you know might be eligible, and encourage them to apply. Also, please feel free to forward this information to any colleagues who might be interested in these award programs. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15, 2022 through January 15, 2023. Recipients will be announced in February 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit Award Applications \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess Path to Psychology and Law Experience Program\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Access Path to Psychology and Law Experience (AP) Program is to increase diversity within psychology and law by increasing the pipeline of competitive graduate school applicants from groups that currently are underrepresented in the field, including racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and disabled students. AP is designed to encourage faculty members to recruit students from underrepresented groups into their research labs. It provides financial support for the students to obtain meaningful research experience and attend the AP-LS conference as well as other opportunities for mentoring and development. It is the intention of the BRIDGE Committee that many of the students in the AP program will apply for graduate training related to psychology and law and ultimately become professionals in the field. The AP program primarily targets undergraduate students, but students from terminal master’s degree programs will also be considered. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15, 2022 through January 15, 2023. Recipients will be announced in February 2023.\n\nFor more information about the AP Program, please contact the program Chair, Dr. Jason Lawrence at jason.lawrence@dmh.mo.gov.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit Award Applications \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAP-LS Diversity in Psychology and Law Research Awards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Diversity in Psychology and Law Research Awards is to promote diversity within the American Psychology-Law Society by supporting student research on psycholegal issues related to diversity as well as research by students from underrepresented groups. Projects are eligible for consideration for this award if (1) they investigate topics related to psychology, law, diversity, and/or multiculturalism (e.g., research pertaining to psycholegal issues on race, gender, culture, sexual orientation, etc.) or (2) if the principal investigator is a member of an underrepresented group, including racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and students with disabilities. Consistent with the mission of the BRIDGE Committee, these awards are intended to facilitate the research of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in AP-LS, as well as research about issues of potential interest and importance to such groups. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15, 2022 through January 15, 2023. Recipients will be announced in February 2023.\n\nFor more information about the Diversity Program, please contact the program Chair, Dr. Evelyn Maeder at evelyn.maeder@carlton.ca.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit Award Applications \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversity Travel Awards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of an initiative to increase diversity within AP-LS, the Minority Affairs Committee will provide travel awards to students from underrepresented groups (i.e., racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and students with disabilities) who are presenting research at the American Psychology-Law Society Conference. Seven competitive travel awards in the amount of $500 will be given. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15, 2022 through January 15, 2023. Recipients will be announced in February 2023.\n\nFor more information about the Diversity Travel Award program, please contact the program Chair, Dr. Amanda NeMoyer at ann38@drexel.edu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit Award Applications \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall for Book Proposals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe American Psychology-Law Society invites proposals for new authored and edited volumes on psychology-law topics for its book series (now published by APA Books).

Neal, AP-LS Member-at-Large, is creating and sending the E-News.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         PILOT GRANT PROGRAM WINNERS This year, we piloted a new grant program called the Funding Program to Enhance the Impact and Diversification of Psychology & Law Research.  The recipients of the grants are described below. Thanks to our Interdisciplinary and Research Grant committees for their innovative leadership, and to the reviewers who served on the review panels.AP-LS awarded one large grant ($42,446) and two small grants ($3,775 and $5,000) through this program.  Details of the projects funded via the large and small grants are below.Large Grant: Connecting Police Practitioners with Researchers: Developing a Law Enforcement Human-Subjects-PoolPI: Kimberly McClure, Western Illinois University Co-PI: Joanne Kurt-Hilditch, Illinois Law Enforcement Training and Standards Board Executive InstituteAbstract: We will establish the Professional Research Pool for Criminal Justice Science (PRP for CJS) directed and operated by the ILETSBEI. We will evaluate it as a mechanism to facilitate police researcher recruitment of representative, police samples, build a stronger partnership between executive law enforcement and researchers and improve the translation and acceptance of police research into policies and practices. This initial project will develop a web-based structure to connect criminal justice professionals and researchers. It will also lead to the development of an advisory board, procedural documents and curriculum development for the consumption and translation of scientific findings into practice and policy. Press release here.  Small Grant: When women conceive in rape: A mixed-methods study of legal experiences, outcomes, and preferencesPI: Lucy Guarnera, University of VirginiaCo-PI: N. Dickon Reppucci, University of VirginiaAbstract: When women conceive in rape, their pregnancy and any resulting birth put them in a unique legal position at the nexus of the criminal justice system and civil/family law system. Legal obstacles and negative perceptions regarding rape-related pregnancy may create serious problems for these doubly vulnerable victims, as well as making it more difficult to successfully prosecute these cases. Despite the significant number of rape-related pregnancies per year in the U.S. (an estimated 32,000) and the variety of laws and policies associated with rape-related pregnancy, no previous empirical research has investigated the legal trajectories of women who conceive in rape. And no empirical work has examined public preferences regarding the web of laws and policies that impact men, women, and children involved in alleged cases of rape-related pregnancy. We propose a two-phase, sequential exploratory mixed methods study to addresses these gaps in the literature.Small Grant: Reducing Cultural Polarization Using Aporetic ReasoningPI: Rob Robertson, California State University - FullertonCo-PI: Danieli Evans, Yale UniversityAbstract: For affect-laden or polarizing policy problems, policymakers and citizens may fail to converge on the best available empirical evidence, instead interpreting evidence and perceiving risks in accordance with their own worldviews. Judicial decisions are not immune to motivated reaction, as courts—particularly appellate courts—frequently must rule on issues that are both polarizing and rest on contested empirical foundations. Judges and other policymakers need evidence-based communication strategies that ameliorate motivated reaction. Our proposal tests the use of aporetic reasoning, a style of justification in which the decision-maker acknowledges the complexity and uncertainty of the question before them, affirming the strongest arguments or the most important values held by the losing side. We hypothesize that aporetic justifications will lower a dispute’s emotional stakes, making individuals less likely to feel that a decision they disagree with is an attack on their identity. We employ an experimental vignettes survey design to test the impact of aporia, using vignettes where judges rule on the constitutionality of state bans on concealed weapons or police use of deadly force. By doing so, we will test how aporetic reasoning impacts perceptions that a decision was accurate, fair and legitimate. Our work sits at the intersection of law, decision-making, psychology, and public opinion, testing a novel theory for reducing the negative impacts of motivated reasoning.STUDENT COMMITTEE ELECTION RESULTSThe Student Committee had many great candidates this year, and are pleased to announce the elected 2017-2018 student representatives:Chair - Amanda Reed | John Jay College of Criminal JusticeChair-Elect - Katherine Hazen | University of Nebraska - LincolnCommunications Officer - Victoria Pietruszka | Drexel UniversityCampus Representative Coordinator - Ryan Hunlock | Palo Alto UniversitySecretary - Keisha April | Drexel UniversityClinical Liaison - Amanda Rosinski | John Jay College of Criminal JusticeExperimental Liaison - Adele Quigley-McBride | Iowa State UniversityLaw Liaison - Emma Marshall  | University of Nebraska-LincolnPast-Chair - Emily Haney-Caron | Drexel UniversityOfficers will officially transition at the Division 41 Business Meeting during the APA Convention.

NEW PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVEEve Brank, Incoming  AP-LS PresidentLater this week, I will have the great honor of being the next AP-LS president. I’m humbled and grateful for the opportunity to serve AP-LS in this new role. As I described at our annual meeting in Seattle, I have an internal and external focus with my presidential initiative.  Internally, I want to focus on the way our organization works and ways to improve transitions between new committee chairs, committee members, and executive committee officers.  Externally, I want to focus on doing good and, at the very least, leave a positive impact in the cities in which we visit for our conferences.  Several of you volunteered to participate in one of these task forces. First, thank you for your willingness to contribute to AP-LS in this way. Second, if you volunteered, you should have received an email from me earlier this week. If you did volunteer and did not receive that email or you are still wanting to volunteer for one of these task forces, please email me by Aug 9 to be added to a group.  I look forward to working with each of to make AP-LS an even better organization than it already is.AP-LS @ APA  Division 41 in D.C.

Perhaps more importantly than the operations of Cook County Jail, Dr. Jones Tapia utilized the workings of her jail (both good and bad) as a method to make a call to action for improving services and outcomes at the correctional facilities in which we are involved every day.  Her specific recommendations:      Expansion of crisis intervention training for law enforcement officers. Provide law enforcement with the tools for effective de-escalation.    Development of partnerships between clinical providers and law enforcement.Collaborative partnerships both enhance law enforcement training and provide valuable service experience for clinicians.    Expansion of crisis services and drop off centers for police. The criminalization of mental illness will continue as long as dropping them off at jail remains easier and more efficient than available treatment centers (e.g., emergency departments).    Use of outpatient commitment. States with outpatient commitment laws can provide insight into effective practices to balance patient rights and reduction of offending behavior.    Dr. Jones Tapia’s work highlights a new era of correctional rehabilitation in which clinicians also provide operational oversight for jails and prisons. Her commentary offers opportunities for practitioners and researchers alike.  If you have a suggestion for correctional topics at future conferences, please send to the Corrections Committee Chair, Sarah Miller.    CALL FOR NOMINATIONS: TEACHING AWARD  The APF 2018 Charles L.

AP-LS 2018 CONFERENCE CALLMark your calendars, the 2018 AP-LS conference will be held March 8th - 10th, 2018! We are excited to host everyone at the grand Peabody Hotel in Memphis, Tennessee.Beginning September 1st, the submission site for the AP-LS 2018 conference Call for Proposals will be available at conferences.ap-ls.org. The deadline for submissions is September 29th, 2017. Here are some exciting new things to be aware of:The submission platform this year allows reviewers to register on the same site, so when you register for the site, consider signing up to review at the same time! We also encourage students to review proposals this year.Consider submitting a Psycho-legal Data-blitz! What is a data-blitz? A data blitz is a series of 5-minute talks (limit 3 slides), covering a bite-sized piece of psycho-legal research. The sessions will offer a fast-paced overview of the most exciting research emerging in psychology and law. Data-blitz sessions will include top-rated papers and will not be organized by topic (great for research and legal scholarship that does not traditionally fit with other AP-LS sessions!)If you have any questions, please contact the 2018 conference co-chairs Nicholas Druhn and Lindsey Wylie  REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS: $1,000 APF Weiss GrantThe American Psychological Foundation’s (APF) 2017 Drs.

The External-Focused Presidential Task Force has developed a few options for the upcoming conference in Memphis and they would like to hear whether you are interested in being involved in this outreach. We have brainstormed a few ideas including doing presentations or trainings with local attorneys, correctional facility employees, social workers, and students in high schools, community colleges, or universities.For those of you who have or who will submit a proposal for the AP-LS conference, the submission portal provides an opportunity to express interest in participating in this externally focused initiative. If you are not planning on submitting a proposal for AP-LS and you would still like to know more about this initiative, then please follow this link http://goo.gl/o8fZBc where you can indicate your interest. Please do so by October 6th. More details will be provided soon!AP-LS STUDENT COMMITTEE: CAREER CORNERThe Career Corner is intended to highlight the individuals who work at the intersection of law and psychology, where they come from, how they got there and how their experiences influence their research, teaching, and/or practice.

As there are many legal issues associated with this, Division 41 would be a natural collaborator in this effort.

We are currently seeking volunteers to help cover the desk. Volunteers will be asked to select at least one hour that works best for them. To be a volunteer consultant, one does not have to be a statistician, only proficient in the computation and/or interpretation of statistics.  For this reason, it will be made clear to consultation table users that the expectation for service should not be comparable to the expectations placed on a paid statistical consultant.  Last, you do not need to be an early career psychologist to volunteer.  If you are interested in volunteering, please email James Andretta at jamesrandretta@gmail.com, and provide him with your full name, your institution, 3 to 4 areas of statistical competence/expertise, and the statistical software package(s) that you are most familiar with using.After the release of the AP-LS 2018 conference schedule, James will provide all volunteers with access to an e-calendar to sign up for a specific day and time to help cover the desk for one hour.

The deadline for submission is June 1st, 2017. Guest Editors: Miko Wilford and Allison Redlich.  This special issue will assemble rigorous research and analytical articles that have the potential to deepen our understanding of guilty pleas (and related aspects) and/or influence policy and practice.

Preference will be given to empirical articles with data.

The AP-LS Executive Committee voted unanimously to approve the revisions and submit them to the AP-LS membership for ratification.  Per the existing By-Laws language in Article VI, Section 1: “Ratification of the proposed amendment requires a two-thirds majority of those of the membership voting, or by a two-thirds vote of those members attending any annual meeting.” Members voted by 2/28/2017 overwhelmingly to change the bylaws (98.77% in favor, 1.23% opposed).  The text of the newly-approved bylaws is on pages 47-51 of this newsletter and will also be available on the AP-LS website soon.

LAW AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR UPDATEMargaret Bull Kovera, Editor-in-ChiefAs 2017 draws to a close, so does my term as Editor-in-Chief of Law and Human Behavior.  With my term ending, I have been reflecting on the changes the journal has undergone during the time I have been a member of the leadership team at LHB, which includes seven years as Associate Editor and six as Editor-in-Chief.  Submissions to the journal have almost doubled. The number of Associate Editors has grown from three to four (and soon five) to keep pace with the growing submissions to the journal. We remain selective in our publication decisions, with rejection rates hovering around 80%.  However, the increasing number of submissions has allowed us to publish more high-quality content per issue, with articles published per issue increasing by almost 50% since I started as Editor-in-Chief. Our impact factor is now 2.822, the highest it has been in more than a decade; the five-year impact factor of 2.919 is the highest ever. I feel comfortable that our team is passing off a healthy journal to the new editorial team.During this time, we negotiated several new publishing contracts, including one that saw us move our production from Springer to the American Psychological Association.  Much in that move was positive, including increased page allotments, better marketing of the journal, and improved production services.  There were a few hiccups, most notably the loss of our placement in Westlaw and Lexis-Nexis during the transition. Although APA was able to negotiate our re-entry into Westlaw relatively rapidly, restoring the inclusion of our content in Lexis has proven to be more difficult. During my term, we have continued to push APA to resolve this issue and I am delighted to report that as of last week Lexis once again has agreed to publish our content, increasing our reach to legal professionals.  Contracts still need to be signed but I have been assured that the deal will be finalized before the end of the year.I have learned so much during my time at the journal, not only about research but about people. I am sure that I made mistakes.  I have tried to correct them when I realized that I had and ask for your forgiveness for those I did not notice. One decision that I am certain was not a mistake was the composition of my editorial team: Amy Bradfield Douglass, David DeMatteo, Bradley McAuliff, and Patricia Zapf. Their decisions were thoughtful and measured, improving the manuscripts that were published in the journal as well as those that eventually were published in other outlets. I am so grateful to them for making this job easier and for making me and the journal look good.It has been a great privilege to serve at the helm of our field’s journal. Thank you all for the honor and please continue to send Law and Human Behavior your best work. AWARDS FOR OUTSTANDING TEACHING & MENTORINGEvery year The American Psychology-Law Society confers two awards for Outstanding Teaching and Mentoring in the field of psychology and law to recognize teaching excellence in a variety of contexts: The Outstanding Teaching and Mentoring Award and the Early Career Teaching and Mentoring Award.

Problem solving courts (PSCs) were developed in the late 1980s to address criminogenic risks and behaviors associated with law breaking, and now exist in the criminal, civil,and family court systems in many nations.This special issue will assemble rigorous experimental and quasi-experimental research to deepen our understanding of problem solving courts’ mechanisms and outcomes after almost thirty years of study.

The AP-LS Executive Committee voted unanimously to approve the revisions and submit them to the AP-LS membership for ratification.  Per the existing By-Laws language in Article VI, Section 1: “Ratification of the proposed amendment requires a two-thirds majority of those of the membership voting, or by a two-thirds vote of those members attending any annual meeting.” The AP-LS Executive Committee is therefore asking AP-LS members to ratify the By-Laws revisions.  Please review this document in advance of the voting to review a summary of the key changes as well the line-by-line specific proposed changes.  The voting link will be mailed to all members eligible to vote soon.

CALL FOR E-NEWS EDITOR  AP-LS has had a quarterly PDF newsletter for many years. However, as part of the organization's plan to become more nimble and modern, we are phasing out the old quarterly PDF newsletter and replacing it with these monthly e-news mailings.  We will continue to have the same kinds of content as the PDF newsletter, but will now deliver the content across 12 months rather than just 4 times per year.    The time has come for a new editor to be appointed to the post.  Matthew Huss's term as the PDF newsletter editor is coming to a close, and AP-LS would like to appoint the new editor to take over the e-news and help transition us from the PDF format into this newer e-news format.Are you interested in serving in this new e-news editor role?  If so, please send an email with your statement of interest and your CV to Jennifer Woolard.  AP-LS COMMITTEE SERVICE OPPORTUNITIESA Note for Committee Chairs and Interested MembersWe launched a google form about two months ago to have people indicate their interest in serving on various AP-LS committees, and the form was announced at the conference too. We have hundreds of people interested in serving on committees, which is great news!  The committee chairs will begin going through the data soon and contacting people who indicated interest in their committees.We are asking all committee chairs and all interested people serving in committees to use this form for the new member application process for the sake of consistency, transparency, and fairness.Full committee terms of reference (descriptions of committees) are here. Committee chairs will use the responses to the form to then contact interested applicants directly with a request for more information. Service terms are normally three years, with initial appointments in August.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW: ADVANCES IN PSYCHOLOGY AND LAW      Part of AP-LS President David DeMatteo's presidential initiative is to send out quarterly updates regarding new cases, laws, etc. that are of interest to the psychology-law community. These updates will be published in the e-news, and the first installment is ready this month.      Jan - Mar 2017 Update    This is the first installment of a quarterly review and summary of the valuable advancements in the psychological and legal fields. Our goal is to present this information in a comprehensive, but an easily digestible format. Each update will include summaries of relevant and current research findings and legal developments with links to further information.  Sometimes staying on top of all the news, research and legal updates relevant to the field can be a daunting task. Our hope with this quarterly update is to save you some time and keep you informed!     In the Courtroom  Jury Decision-MakingWorried about evidence suggesting race bias in juries? On March 6, 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that courts must make an exception to the rule that jury deliberations remain secret if they are impacted by racial or ethnic bias. See Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado. For those who do conduct jury simulation research, this new study may help alleviate concerns about using undergraduate student samples to represent mock juries.Using Race as a Risk Factor: Racial Bias in the CourtroomThe Supreme Court recently held that a Texas death row inmate’s sentencing was unfairly biased by blatantly racist expert testimony. In short, his own attorney’s expert testified that the defendant is more likely to commit violent acts because he is black. See Buck v. Davis.Juvenile Sentencing: What Does Society Think?As a reminder, SCOTUS recently held that mandatory life in prison without parole (LWOP)  for juvenile offenders is unconstitutional (because it violates the 8th Amendment prohibition of “cruel and unusual punishment”).  But what about non-mandatory LWOP sentencing? A recent study examined the public’s sentiment regarding juvenile LWOP and, among other findings, found that only 31% of participants agree with juvenile LWOP as a general policy.Intellectual Disability and the Death PenaltyOn March 28, 2017 the Supreme Court continued its trend toward limiting capital punishment for those with intellectual disability (continued in next column).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW (CONTINUED)(Continued from previous column). The Court rejected Texas’s standards for deciding whether an individual’s intellectual disability would preclude him from receiving the death penalty. In writing for the majority, Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg reasoned that Texas’s approach was not consistent with current medical standards, placed too much weight on I.Q. scores, and considered factors rooted in stereotypes.  See Moore v. Texas. In the Community     Improving the Process for Prisoner ReentryReentry programming for previously incarcerated offenders seems like a great idea, but where is the research supporting it? Recent research has shown that individuals feel they may not be receiving the services they need. So what’s the answer? Better integrate offender-perceived needs with needs highlighted in actuarial assessments.This bill filed in Kentucky, if passed, may be a good model for improving success in reentry. The bill aims to provide workforce training during incarceration, ease restrictions that prevent released offenders from getting jobs, and provide a reentry drug supervision pilot program.Improving Citizen-Law Enforcement Relations: Police AccountabilityThis global multi-site randomized clinical trial examined the use of body-worn cameras on police and whether it reduced citizen’s complaints. Studies like this are increasingly more important as tensions have increased among officers and the populations they serve.Mental Health Care & the Trump AdministrationAs many are aware, the Trump administration has begun to withdraw federal protections for transgender individuals. This will likely have a large impact on the transgender community, and an even larger impact for incarcerated transgender individuals. As institutional barriers are resurrected, it might be helpful for practicing clinicians to review these guidelines when working with transgender clients. As the status of the Affordable Care Act remains in question, see this article for the perspective of some concerned psychologists.  Final ThoughtsAnd Lastly, on a positive note…For information on a promising program, check out NPR’s inspiring Hidden Brain podcast on a CBT program in Chicago designed to reduce violence and increase high school graduate rates among teenage boys.Until June!If you have questions, or see or read something you would like to see included in future updates, please contact us!

At one point, her kids shared a story about while growing up, they would go to events like the state fair and be one of the few families of color present. They would look at each other, smile, and say “Spot on a cow.” This is how they acknowledged that they were some of the few people of color at an event or outing. In this brief essay I will explain how being a spot on a cow led to my becoming a forensic psychologist and how it continues to shape the way I conceptualize and conduct forensic interviews.To read the column, please click here.RESEARCH BRIEFSTake a look at the latest research briefs for short summaries of the latest articles relevant to psychology-law. To read the research briefs, please click here.NEWSLETTER ARCHIVES  Archives of the  newsletter are available at http://ap-ls.wildapricot.org/Newsletter.

LHB IS GOING GREEN IN 2019In August 2017, the Division 41 Executive Committee unanimously voted to renew its lucrative contract with the American Psychological Association to publish Law and Human Behavior through 2023.

It is important that you promptly respond to this email to help keep AP-LS's voice heard within APA.Your vote will determine how many voting members AP-LS gets on APA's governing body, the Council of Representatives. Right now, AP-LS has two representatives. Depending on the number of votes that AP-LS gets during this ballot process, AP-LS could gain or lose a representative. Each APA member is given 10 votes. Please give all 10 of your votes to Division 41/AP-LS. This ballot also includes a proposed change to the APA bylaws to allow some graduate student members the right to vote in some APA elections, as further explained on the ballot. In August, the APA Council of Representatives (including the two AP-LS representatives) voted in favor (73.4%) of the item, and the APA Board of Directors recommended approval. If you have any questions, please contact Jason Cantone, at jasoncantone@gmail.com. If you are an APA member and did not receive the ballot email, please contact Garnett Coad, at gcoad@apa.org. UNDERSTANDING THE NEEDS OF AP-LS EARLY CAREER PROFESSIONALSIn late 2018, 119 AP-LS early career professionals (ECPs) completed a detailed survey regarding their graduate training, professional development, current career path, and recommendations for how AP-LS can meet the needs of ECPs. This survey provided a wealth of information. Some findings include: -  Diversity. Respondents overwhelmingly self-identified as White (81%) and female (83%) and noted a need for more diversity awareness and recruitment, as well as a desire for more training in socio-cultural issues in law and psychology, and harassment and discrimination claims. - Debt. Respondents’ average student debt load at the time of graduation was a little over $100,000, with about $89,000 attributable solely to graduate training. Respondents who received a PsyD reported the highest debt load. - Meeting ECP Needs.  Only 5% of respondents said that AP-LS addressed their needs extremely well, with the most saying moderately well. Respondents recommended that AP-LS provide further opportunities regarding peer networking, professional networking, and how to establish collaborations outside of academia. - Policy and Applied Areas. Respondents reported satisfaction with many aspects of their graduate training, but many expressed disappointment with a lack of guidance on going into the non-academic job market, and a need for more training in policy areas and better experiential learning opportunities. This was especially likely for social science respondents. The full report is available here.

LAW AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR UPDATEBradley D. McAuliff, JD, PhD (bradley.mcauliff@csun.edu)California State University, NorthridgeThe Editorial Team recently received two important journal updates that we would like to share with Division 41.This summer, Clarivate Analytics’ Social Science Citation Index released LHB’s impact factor for 2018. Measuring the average number of times articles from the journal published in 2016 and 2017 were cited in 2018, the impact factor decreased slightly from 2.867 in 2017 to 2.780 in 2018. The journal’s 5-year impact factor, measuring the average number of times articles from the journal published between 2013 and 2017 were cited in 2018, rose from to 3.245 to 3.372.LHB’s ranking in the law category was 11 out of 148 and the journal was outranked by only one other psychology title, European Journal of Psychology Applied to Legal Context, which is an open access journal. In the social psychology category, LHB ranked 15 out of 63.APA Journals also released its annual publishing report for LHB. The rate of submissions to the journal in 2018 increased 3% compared to 2017 and the rate is about 12% higher so far this year. The rejection rate decreased slightly from 85% last year to 81% in 2018. Editorial lag, or time between submission and first decision, also decreased from 6 weeks in 2017 to 4 weeks last year. Production lag, or time between acceptance and publication in an issue, was about 6 weeks for articles posted online and less than 3 months for articles included in issues.The impact of LHB--combined with the steady submission rate, a short editorial and publication lag, and a rejection rate that hovers around 80%--suggests the journal remains very healthy. That said, we continue to need your best work! This is especially the case for clinical submissions, which are underrepresented and constitute roughly 20% of all submissions to the journal. Please consider submitting now and do not hesitate to contact me, or any of the Associate Editors (David DeMatteo, Amanda Zelechoski, Jennifer Hunt, Lora Levett, and Kyle Scherr) if you have any questions or we can help in any way.CALL FOR SYLLABIThe TTC Committee is continuing its efforts to collect syllabi for courses in Psychology and Law or closely related topics. There are already a number of syllabi that have been collected over the years on the AP-LS website. However, we would like to routinely post new syllabi. We would appreciate your assistance in providing us with a copy of your syllabi.If you have not already provided one, please do so in the following way: Send a copy of your syllabi to Jonathan Golding (golding@uky.edu). Soft copies may be submitted as e-mail attachments (Word Perfect, Word, or ASCII files are preferred).AP-LS BOOK AWARD COMMITTEE INVITES NOMINATIONSThe AP-LS Book Award Committee is inviting nominations to recognize outstanding scholarship in psychology and law edited books published in 2017 and 2018.

Though applying psychological research to the legal system goes back as far as 1885, it was officially recognized by the American Psychological Association in 2001 and has since experienced rapid growth.  As the field of forensic psychology continues to advance, it is imperative training and educational curricula adequately prepares future practitioners and researchers alike.To read this column, please click here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 LEGAL UPDATE: CONTINUING EDUCATION TO BETTER ENHANCE THE ATTORNEY/CLINICIAN RELATIONSHIPContent Contributors: Michael L. Perlin, Esq. & Heather Ellis CucoloThe two of us have taught together, written together, consulted and presented together for years. Mostly, we have done this with lawyers, law students, psychologists and psychology students. For 14 years, one of us (MLP) ran an online mental disability law program at New York Law School (NYLS), and for the last five, HEC has run it. Through this program, we have offered courses at NYLS and at other law schools and graduate schools (including a school of professional psychology) throughout the US and in multiple foreign nations. We also, for eight years, ran a masters’ program in mental disability law studies, and psychologists regularly made up a majority of students in that program. And we created a joint program with John Jay so that students could receive a J.D. from NYLS and an M.A. in forensic psychology from Jay.To read this column, please click here.

AP-LS VOICES HEARD IN APACongratulations to Dr. Erika Fountain on her selection as a member of the new APA Advisory Group for Applied Psychology. The advisory group, which will be led by APA's Office of Applied Psychology, will have two main charges: 1) to make recommendations about how applied psychology can be better represented in APA; and 2) serve as a source of input and feedback regarding applied psychology issues and priorities. We are excited to see AP-LS part of this important advisory group.Jason Cantone was selected for the new APA Work Group on Accommodating Young Families. The work group is tasked with examining how APA could better support young families attending governance meetings and the annual convention (e.g., child care grants, on-site child care, nursing resources, family-friendly resources). During the first meeting, AP-LS was commended for its child care grants to assist families attending the annual AP-LS conference. If you're interested in serving on an APA group, APA is currently looking for new members for its Continuing Education Committee (applications due August 12), Committee on Early Career Psychologists (due August 28), Committee on Disability Issues in Psychology (due August 30), and APA Fellows Committee (due September 10). Contact APA Council Representative Jason Cantone (jasoncantone@gmail.com) for application materials. AP-LS CONTACTSEmail addresses for all current EC members and Committee Chairs can be found here.NEWSLETTER ARCHIVESArchives of the  newsletter are available at http://ap-ls.wildapricot.org/Newsletter.

APA UPDATE: STUDENT/ECP GRANTS AND CALL FOR COMMENTS(1) The American Psychological Foundation and APA announced $1,000 grants to seed innovation through supporting teaching, education, and intervention projects and programs using psychology to solve social problems such as: how to apply psychology to at-risk, vulnerable populations (e.g., serious mental illness, returning military, those who are incarcerated or economically disadvantaged), preventing violence, understanding the connection between behavior and health (e.g. wellness, diabetes, obesity), and understanding and eliminating stigma and prejudice (e.g. race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability and socioeconomic status). Applicants must be graduate students or early career researchers (within 10 years of Ph.D.) More information can be obtained at https://www.apa.org/apf/funding/weiss.  Applications are due September 15, 2019. (2) APA seeks member and public comments on the proposed Guidelines for Psychological Practice with Military Service Members, Veterans, and their Families (SMVF). The purpose of these guidelines is to “provide recommendations for psychologists who provide services to SMVF outside of Veterans Health Administration or U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) facilities.” In addition, these guidelines aim to “highlight the main issues that are unique to this particular population that would not necessarily also be of consideration in the civilian population. The successful application of these guidelines involves use of clinical judgment, recognition of one’s own scope of practice, and an understanding of the extent to which military status is part of an individual’s identity or relevant to the individual’s need for psychological care.” Comments can be provided by June 7, 2019 at http://apps.apa.org/commentcentral2/default.aspx?site=40.  For questions related to these updates, please contact your APA Council of Representatives delegates Tom Grisso or Jason Cantone (jasoncantone@gmail.com).

Though we have successfully developed such treatments for many forensic populations, there remains a lack of clearly identified and supported evidenced-based practices for individuals who have committed sexual offenses. In this three-part series, Amanda M. Fanniff, Ph.D., Associate Professor at Palo Alto University, will review current practices and examine whether such treatments actually “work.” This month’s column, Does Treatment for Adults who have Committed Sexual Offenses Work? A Simple Question with a Complicated Answer, focuses on adults who have committed sexual offenses and the next two will look at adolescents who have committed sexual offenses as well as minor attracted persons who want to remain offense-free. We start by asking the question, “How do we measure treatment in this area?”. To read this column, please click here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          AP-LS BOOK AWARD COMMITTEE INVITES NOMINATIONSThe AP-LS Book Award Committee invites nominations to recognize outstanding scholarship in psychology and law edited books published in 2017 and 2018.

APA COMMITTEE ON LEGAL ISSUES (COLI) SEEKS NEW MEMBERSThe APA Committee on Legal Issues (COLI) is one of the most pertinent ways for AP-LS members to become better involved in APA governance and leadership activities. COLI makes recommendations, prepares and issues reports, and educates APA and psychologists about psycho-legal issues and to promote the field of psychology as it interfaces with the law. COLI does not serve as legal counsel to or form an attorney-client relationship with the APA or the Board of Directors. Instead, COLI has a primary responsibility for serving as a “think tank” for the Board of Directors on psycho-legal issues. Nominations are sought for one JD/PhD position and two PhD or PsyD positions. The term of service for all positions is Jan. 1, 2020-Dec. 31, 2022. COLI members must also be APA members. Applications should include (1) a brief statement of no more than 300 words detailing qualifications, and (2) a current curriculum vitae. Nominees' materials will be reviewed by COLI and COLI will send their recommendations to the Board of Directors for review. Applications are due September 27 to COLInominations@apa/org. For more information, please go to: https://www.apa.org/about/offices/ogc/legal-committee-nominations.AP-LS 2020 CONFERENCEThe conference submission site for the AP-LS 2020 conference will be open on September 1, 2019, with submissions due by 11:59 PST on October 4, 2019.

MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (2018)Whereas threat assessment professionals in the United States and Canada may well be aware of case law, other legal standards, and their professional responsibilities regarding assessing and managing risk of violence toward others, fewer may be as familiar with sources of authority regarding self-directed violence threat assessment. It may be reassuring to know that our professional responsibilities related to assessing and managing other- and self-directed violence are somewhat analogous, and the courts have historically, as well as more recently, underscored this view.To read more about this, please click here.CAREER CORNERThe Career Corner is intended to highlight the individuals who work at the intersection of law and psychology, where they come from, how they got there and how their experiences influence their research, teaching, and/or practice.

PRESIDENTIAL COLUMNJennifer GroscupIt was an honor to be elected President of AP-LS, and I am very much looking forward to working with all of you in the upcoming year on our organization. The first thing I want to do is tell you about my Presidential initiative: Embracing Leadership: Developing Skills for Your Career Evolution. This is a leadership training program for our members that will provide participants with the skills and the opportunities to become leaders within our Division and beyond. Based on surveys of our membership and on the surveys done on specific subgroups within our membership (ECPs, Student Section, etc.), there appears to be a high level of interest in leadership development. Many members have expressed the desire to be involved in leadership, but they feel it is difficult to “break into” leadership in the Division. This perception is one of many barriers to leadership for our members, and this feeling is not limited to leadership within the Division.To read the rest of this column, please click here. DIVISION 41 CALL FOR REVIEWERS: APA 128th 2020 ANNUAL CONVENTIONWe are looking for reviewers to review submitted programming proposals for the 128th Annual Convention of the American Psychological Association to be held Aug 6 – 9, 2020 in Washington, DC.Proposals will be in the following formats: symposia, skill-building sessions, discussions, data blitzes, and posters.Student reviewers are welcome!For more information, please click here.The deadline to sign up to be a reviewer is December 2, 2019.CALL FOR APPLICATIONS: EMBRACING LEADERSHIP: DEVELOPING SKILLS FOR YOUR CAREER EVOLUTIONThe American Psychology-Law Society is starting a leadership development program, and we encourage any and all members to apply for this exciting opportunity!Embracing Leadership is designed to provide our members with practical training in leadership and with leadership opportunities within AP-LS.

COLI makes recommendations, prepares and issues reports, and educates APA and psychologists about psycho-legal issues and to promote the field of psychology as it interfaces with the law. COLI does not serve as legal counsel to or form an attorney-client relationship with the APA or the Board of Directors. Instead, COLI has a primary responsibility for serving as a “think tank” for the Board of Directors on psycho-legal issues. Nominations are sought for one JD/PhD position and two PhD or PsyD positions. The term of service for all positions is Jan. 1, 2020-Dec. 31, 2022. COLI members must also be APA members. Applications should include (1) a brief statement of no more than 300 words detailing qualifications, and (2) a current curriculum vitae. Nominees' materials will be reviewed by COLI and COLI will send their recommendations to the Board of Directors for review.For more information, please click here.Applications are due October 8, 2019 to COLInominations@apa.org.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       AAFP DISSERTATION GRAND AWARDSThe American Academy of Forensic Psychology (AAFP) is pleased to announce the following individuals have been awarded Dissertation Grant Awards for 2019.

February 14-17, 2019. APLS/Division 41 is represented by Jason Cantone and Tom Grisso. At the meeting, Jason Cantone was re-appointed to the Council Diversity Working Group, and elected Member-at-Large for the Public Interest Caucus. Among items on the agenda, Council approved the:· Resolution on Campus Sexual Assault,· Clinical Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Depression Across Three Age Cohorts,· Resolution on Physical Discipline of Children by Parents, after some concerns were expressed about whether the resolution’s claim that science supports that spanking leads to negative outcomes has actually been shown, and concern that the resolution would result in disparities for certain racial, ethnic or cultural communities more likely to use spanking,· 2019 Children and Adolescent Mental and Behavioral Health Resolution (rescinding the now out-of-date 2004 resolution on the same topic),· Revised Model Education and Training Program in Psychopharmacology for Prescriptive Authority,· Creation of a new APA journal, Technology, Mind, and Behavior, and· Proposed change to rules on how Divisions can issue public statements on matters consistent with APA policy, and the information required in APA elections.Last year, Council passed a “transparency” rule to provide for representatives’ individual votes to be made available on the APA website, if 2/3 of Council voted to do so at the beginning of each meeting. Although both APLS representatives voted in support, only 58% of Council supported the motion and it did not pass. Following passionate discussion on the Council members’ LISTSERV, there was an information session regarding the ethical, moral, and legal issues surrounding APA accrediting graduate psychology programs at schools that discriminate against minority (generally, on the basis of sexual orientation) populations. A New Business Item on this issue was proposed for discussion at future meetings.Council also heard from task forces on (1) the new APA strategic plan, which seeks to create a more unifying framework within APA to more readily advocate for psychology, and (2) master’s program accreditation, which will next work on articulating competencies and accreditation standards for masters-level health services professionals, which will still need to be developed and approved.For more on these issues, please contact APLS Council Rep Jason Cantone at jasoncantone@gmail.com. AP-LS CONTACTSEmail addresses for all current EC members and Committee Chairs can be found here.

The HIG research program commissions basic and applied scientific studies and field validation/effectiveness studies to examine current and new approaches to interrogation to develop and refine an effective, non-coercive, science-based model of interrogation, interviewing, and debriefing that is both legally and ethically sound. We fund/commission these basic and applied research projects through a mechanism called the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). We are currently soliciting new white papers for potential contract funding with a deadline of March 29, 2019.For more information, please click here and select “Amendment 1” for the current call for papers.

In this election, three APA divisions lost a seat (Divisions 17 - Counseling; 32 - Humanistic; and 36 - Religion and Spirituality), and three APA divisions gained a seat (Divisions 39 - Psychoanalysis; 42 - Independent Practice; and 45 - Culture, Ethnicity and Race).

The results determine the composition of APA's Council of Representatives. With the voting now closed, AP-LS retained its two seats for 2021. Two divisions lost a seat (Society for the Psychology of Women; Trauma Psychology) and two divisions gained a seat (Society of Counseling Psychology; Society for the Psychology of Religion and Spirituality). The percentage of votes AP-LS received slightly increased compared to last year, but AP-LS remains very low in the voting tallies. Make sure to vote each year to keep AP-LS' voice heard in APA! In 2020, the AP-LS Council representatives are Jason Cantone and Margaret Bull Kovera. \n\nThe bylaws amendment seeking to expand APA voting privileges for graduate students failed by a very narrow margin. Bylaws amendments must be approved by two-thirds (66.67%) of APA voting members, but only 65.98% voted to approve this amendment. The measure passed Council in August 2019 with 73% of Council Representatives voting yes. \n\n\n\n\n\nNEWSLETTER ARCHIVES\n\nArchives of the  newsletter are available at http://ap-ls.wildapricot.org/Newsletter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020 AP-LS CONFERENCE DETAILS\n\nThe 2020 AP-LS conference is quickly approaching.  The conference will be held in New Orleans, LA at the Sheraton Hotel, Canal Street, March 5 – March 7.  Continuing Education workshops will be held on Wednesday, March 4.\n\nHotel reservations and conference registration can be made at http://ap-ls.wildapricot.org.\n\nConference Early Bird registration ends January 31, 2020.\n\n\n\nAP-LS 2020 PRE-CONFERENCE WORKSHOP GRANTS\n\nThe AP-LS Continuing Education (CE) Committee is pleased to offer 10 grants to students and early career psychologists (defined as 7 years or less since last terminal degree was awarded) to attend pre-conference CE workshops on March 4, 2020.\n\nTo apply for one of these grants (which cover the workshop registration fee), please complete the application at https://forms.gle/Bk276VHScTUeapqf7 by Friday, January 10, 2020.  \n\nGrant recipients will be notified by January 24, 2020 (prior to the early registration rate deadline; Note: if you have already registered for a workshop, you can still apply and receive a refund for your registration fee). \n\nContact Beth Arredondo (bethcaillouet@gmail.com) with any questions.  \n\nWe look forward to receiving your applications!\n\n\n\nON THE JOB OR POSTDOC MARKET? AP-LS JOB POSTINGS\n\nCheck out AP-LS's Job Postings Page for up-to-date information on available psychology-law positions here.\n\nNote that new positions are available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLAW AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR UPDATES \n\nBradley D. McAuliff, JD, PhD (bradley.mcauliff@csun.edu)\n\nEditor-in-Chief\n\nI am excited to announce that Dr. Jennifer Cox has joined the Editorial Team of Law and Human Behavior. She and Dr. Dave DeMatteo will work with reviewers to make publication decisions for clinical submissions to the journal.\n\nDr. Cox received her doctorate in clinical psychology from Texas A&M University in 2014. She is currently an Associate Professor who specializes in clinical psychology-law at The University of Alabama. She has served on LHB Editorial Board since 2015 and currently serves on the editorial board of three journals and the AP-LS Committees for Research and Dissertation Awards. Her research interests include the impact of gender and race biases on legal decision making, forensic mental health assessment, psychopathy, and the interaction of psychology and public policy.\n\nDr. Cox replaces Dr. Amanda Zelechoski, who recently stepped down as Associate Editor to tend to family medical issues and to focus on several new projects. The journal not only benefitted from Dr. Zelechoski’s expertise as AE—she was also the driving force behind the journal’s new Reviewer Mentee Program. On behalf of Division 41, the LHB Editorial Team would like to thank Amanda for her service and we look forward to working with Dr. Cox in her new role as Associate Editor.\n\n\n\nRESEARCH BRIEFS\n\nTake a look at the latest research briefs for short summaries of the latest articles relevant to psychology-law. \n\nTo read the research briefs, please click here.AP-LS CONTACTS\n\nEmail addresses for all current EC members and Committee Chairs can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Editorial Board  Editor Marc Patry marc.patry@smu.ca Associate Editor Leah Georges  leahgeorges@creighton.edu Student Assistant Editor Sarah Shaw sarah.shaw@smu.ca Content Editors -  Research Briefs Charles Stone &  Rebecca  Weiss  chstone@jjay.cuny.edu rweiss@jjay.cuny.edu Content Editor - Legal Update Christopher King  kingch@mail.montclair.edu Content Editor - Expert Opinion  Melinda Wolbransky melinda.wolbransky@gmail.com Content Editor - Teaching in Psych & Law Christina Riggs Romaine riggsromaine_christina@wheatoncollege.edu Content Editor - Advances in Psych &  Law Alice Thornewill & Shelby Arnold alice.thornewill@gmail.com shelby.a.arnold@gmail.com Content Editor - Career CornerVictoria Pietruszka aplsstudents@gmail.comMembership Services        AP-LS seeks to advance the science of psychology - law and the translation of psychology-law knowledge into practice and policy.  Our mission is to enhance well-being, justice, and human rights through science and practice of psychology in legal contexts. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Copyright © American Psychology-Law Society                        Division 41 of the American Psychological Association All rights reserved.                   PO Box 805, Harrisburg, NC 28075Unsubscribe from E-NewsUnsubscribe from all APLS e-mails\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n    © 2022 American Psychology-Law Society  made with  and Quarto"

I hope you are as excited as I am to see some great presentations, get involved in the Division, and catch up with friends and colleagues. As I’m sure you saw in your emails, the final program grid has been released. It can be found here. There are many exciting sessions offered! First, check out this year’s slate of pre-conference CE offerings. In keeping with my presidential initiative about expanding our research to address the needs of judges, the Presidential Plenary this year will be an “in conversation” with judges about their practice and research interests. There will be other fabulous special sessions offered by our hard-working committees that I want to highlight here. On Thursday, the Student Section will be offering a session titled “Bridging the Gap: Confinement in the Juvenile Justice System.” On Friday, the Research Committee will be offering a session discussing open science titled “Opening the Door for Better Science in Psychology and Law: The Benefits of Open Science Practices,” the Minority Affairs Committee will be offering “Preventing Wrongful Convictions & Bringing Innocent Clients Home,” and the Early Career Professionals Committee will present “Identifying & Meeting the Needs of Early Career Professionals in Law & Psychology.” On Saturday, the Teaching, Training, and Careers Committee will host “Influencing Change: The Varied Lives of Policy Work,” and the Professional Development of Women Committee will present “Terrified & Doing It Anyway: Embracing Your Inner Imposter.” Make sure you schedule time to check out some of the amazing work our committees are doing! All are invited to attend the Business Meeting on Thursday evening from 6-6:30, where you can learn about news in the Division and opportunities to get involved. Finally, don’t miss your chance to support the Student Section by participating in the 5k Fun Run!\n\n\n\nLEGAL UPDATE: RESOLUTION OR RESIGNATION: THE ROLE OF FORENSIC MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AMIDST THE COMPETENCY SERVICES CRISIS\n\nCompetency-related cases often occur in under-resourced, over-taxed systems of evaluation and care, despite the efforts of dedicated personnel found working in those systems. Forensic psychologists may have difficulty adhering to overarching ethical principles if our work occurs unabated in the midst of the inhumane conditions that often surround competency-related services. How should forensic professionals seek to resolve this challenge, if at all?\n\nTo read this column, please click here.\n\n\n\nPRE-CONFERENCE WORKSHOP CE AND CLE\n\nAP-LS has received approval to provide CLE to Louisiana Bar Association members in addition to CE for psychologists.

FINKELI regret to inform the Division that one of our distinguished members, Norman J. Finkel passed away last month on December 2, 2019. Norm Finkel spent most of his career in the Psychology Department at Georgetown University. He was on the faculty for thirty-seven years, beginning in 1970. He received his bachelor’s degree in Psychology from N.Y.U., where he studied with Phil Zimbardo, and his Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from Rochester University. At Georgetown, he taught Abnormal Psychology and Psychology and Law, as well as advanced seminars in Theories of Therapy, and Madness, Genius, and Creativity. In 2005, he received the College Dean’s Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching, reflecting his deep devotion to undergraduate students whom he taught with great dedication, flair, and with a particular focus on deepening students’ thinking and critical capacities. He was a leader in the field of psychology and law. During his career, he wrote many influential books in the field including Therapy and Ethics: The Courtship of Law and Psychology (1980), Mental Illness and Health (1982), Insanity on Trial (1988), Commonsense Justice: Jurors’ Notions of the Law (1995), Not Fair! The Typology of Commonsense Unfairness (2001), The Psychology of Rights and Duties: Empirical Contributions and Normative Commentaries (2005), and Emotions and Culpability: How the Law Is at Odds with Psychology, Jurors, and Itself (2006). He is survived by his daughter Jennifer, his sister Debbie, and countless friends and family, including his good friend Steve Sabat, Emeritus at Georgetown, who provided me with much of the information above from his own tribute to Norm for the department.\n\nThis is a great personal loss for me, as well as a loss for our field. I first met Norm as a student in his Theories of Therapy class at Georgetown. He was an exceptional teacher – funny, quirky, and engaging. There always was an element of theater in his teaching. If I’m being honest, I was an unexceptional student in that class. That was not our moment. In the fall of my senior year, I was still at a bit of a loss for what area of psychology interested me most. I knew I wanted to pursue something in the area of criminal psychology, but I wasn’t sure what or how. That’s when I took his Psychology and Law class, and it changed my life. Not only did it inspire me intellectually to pursue work in this field, but it also gave me a roadmap for how to teach more generally. In that class, there were so many “Jennifer”s (as is the curse of many people my age), that he gave us all nicknames. Mine was “44” because my middle name is Leigh, and Lee Grosscup (no relation to my knowledge) was an NFL Football player who I guess played with that number. At the very bottom of his syllabus for the class he encouraged anyone interested in doing research to contact him. I had never seen that before as a student. At the time, I had no idea what that really meant but I thought why not? I didn’t know going in what a prolific researcher he was or how important that experience would be for me. I worked with him my whole senior year, learning how to design studies, collect data, and most importantly, how to “think big” about the impact of psychology on the legal system.\n\nI continued to work with him for three years after graduation until I went to graduate and law school. He was a constant guiding force for me, providing me with opportunities, advice, and new knowledge. I know I would not be where I am today, in this field and in a career that I love, without his mentoring. Now, as a professor, I try to emulate his enthusiasm for learning and his openness and dedication to undergraduate research and education. I put a similar blurb at the bottom of the syllabus in every class I teach, inviting students to contact me if they are interested in research. I tell them this story. I have met and mentored some of the most amazing people because of this – because of him. I’m sure many of you have a “Norm” in your lives that sparked your interest in psychology and law. Take a minute to let them know, and never underestimate your own ability to light that spark for someone else.\n\nIn fond remembrance,\n\nJen Groscup (44)\n\nIf you would like to make a donation to honor his memory, the family has suggested the ACLU and the Holocaust Memorial in Washington DC as organizations with missions close to his heart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n    \n              \n            \n          \n      \n    \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n      \n    \n          \n            \n      \n        \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n      \n        \n            \n              \n                \n      LAW AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR UPDATE\n\nLora M. Levett, PhD\n\nAssociate Editor\n\nllevett@ufl.edu\n\nAnnouncing the 2020 Law and Human Behavior Reviewer Mentoring Program!\n\nHave you always wondered how people get to be reviewers for prestigious journals? Are you interested in becoming a reviewer for LHB (the official journal of AP-LS), but don’t know what that means or how to get training and experience with providing strong reviews? Do you have limited or no access to a mentor that can provide you with this type of experience? If so, now’s your chance to develop your reviewer skills!\n\nThe LHB editorial team is continuing their Reviewer Mentoring Program in 2020 to provide current graduate students and ECPs (within 10 years of last terminal degree) with training and mentoring specifically in conducting strong peer reviews. If you will be attending the AP-LS conference in March 2020 and do not have access to this type of mentoring in your current graduate program, we invite you to apply for the program.\n\nWe will be selecting a small pilot group of Reviewers to participate in a training workshop at the 2020 AP-LS conference and then matching those participants with Reviewer Mentors. Mentees will then be assigned several manuscripts to review throughout 2020, under the supervision and guidance of their Reviewer Mentor.\n\nIf you would like to be considered for this program, please complete the application at the following link by February 5 (https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LHBReviewing). \n\n\n\n2020 APA CONVENTION HIGHLIGHTS\n\nDivision 41 in D.C. \n\nAugust 6-9\n\nDivision 41 has developed an exciting program based on the numerous high-quality submissions received. Highlights include the discussion Want more forensic psychologists of color? Try listening, as well as the symposia Considerations for forensic evaluations with adults diagnosed with Intellectual Disabilities and Mass Shootings in America: A multi-method study of the past 50 years. Of note, APA at large is \"re-envisioning\" the Convention, which has been associated with a decrease in Division-specific programming hours. We received many more submissions than our allotted hours (15). This made for a very competitive process. Thank you to all reviewers who volunteered their time and expertise. See you in D.C.! \n\n\n\n5K FUN RUN!\n\nDon't forget to sign up for the Annual Student Committee 5k Fun Run before February 15, 2020! \n\nThe Annual 5K will be Friday, March 6, 2020 at 7:00 AM. Registration is $25.00 and includes a t-shirt as well as snacks after the race. All proceeds go to support the Student Committee activities. Sign up for the Fun Run here.\n\nThis year, we're going digital! When you register, you must also complete this waiver and upload it with your registration.\n\n\n\nREPRESENT AP-LS ON APA BOARDS AND COMMITTEES!\n\nOne great way for AP-LS members to make sure AP-LS' voice is heard within APA (and gain valuable leadership experience!) is to serve on APA boards and committees. To be eligible, you must be an APA member and apply through the APA Online Portal by March 6, 2020.

APLS was represented by Jason Cantone and Joel Lieberman. At this meeting, Council voted to move forward on accrediting master's level psychology programs and approved guidelines on core learning goals for master's degree graduates in psychology.This occurred after about 70 years of discussion on the topic of master's programs. APA also shared that, for the first time, there were more internship positions available than applicants. For the 432 unmatched students in the 2018 APPIC Phase I match, 457 APA/CPA-accredited internships were still open.Council also voted to approve a major organizational structure change, with APA changing from a 501(c)(3) to a joint 501(c)(6) organization. Why does this matter? The changed tax status allows for more advocacy and fewer lobbying restrictions. APA promised that increased lobbying will be on behalf of science as much as for practitioner issues. All APA members will become members of this new joint organization when they renew next year. APA promised that dues will not go up for at least three years, but there is concern they will go up after that, because APAPO (APA's current 501(c)(6) to focus on practice issues) will no longer receive its own, separate dues. Final plans will be discussed at APA in August. In addition, APA is currently hiring a Chief Ethics Officer and will begin the process of hiring a Chief Diversity Officer later this year.If you have any questions about these decisions or would like to know more about the other decisions at Council, including the passage of new clinical practice guidelines regarding obesity, please contact Jason Cantone (jasoncantone@gmail.com). COMMONLY REPORTED STATISTICS & CONCEPTS QUICK REFERENCE SHEETMorgan, Slobogin, & Andretta (2018) reviewed 93 articles published in 2017 in Psychology, Public Policy, and Law or Law and Human Behavior in order to determine the most commonly reported statistical coefficients and concepts.

EXPERT OPINION: HOT TUBBING AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO ADVERSARIAL EXPERT TESTIMONYInitially developed in Australian courts, concurrent expert testimony, or “hot tubbing,” is a practice in which two experts sit together in a witness box and provide concurrent testimony. Could this legal innovation decrease expert bias and increase juror comprehension in the United States legal system?To read the expert opinion, please click here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                PRESIDENT'S COLUMNEve Brank, JD, PhDI hope everyone who was able to attend our annual conference in Memphis left feeling as reinvigorated about their work as I did! A hearty thank you to Lindsey Wylie and Nick Druhn, our conference co-chairs for their tireless work on the conference program and so much more.  The plenary sessions were thought-provoking and encouraged me to approach issues differently than I had before.  The new data blitz sessions were a welcome opportunity to get to hear research from a variety of different areas that I likely would not have seen without the data blitz format. Thank you also to Kathy Gaskey, our administrative assistant, for her work with the conference and our organization all year. At the conference, we did several calls for committee volunteers and we have already had a great response. More than 150 people have volunteered to be considered for a committee position.  If you did not have a chance to submit your interest in joining a committee, please do so here https://goo.gl/forms/iQF3X5NtDnofxcUx2 by April 15th. With so many volunteers, it is a fairly lengthy process to get all our committee positions set by mid-summer in time for the annual process of rotating on new members at the APA meeting in August. I ask for your patience as we work through the process, but also feel free to reach out to me at ebrank2@unl.edu if you have any questions. VOLUNTEER FOR AP-LS COMMITTEESAP-LS is looking to recruit volunteers! The Executive Committee of AP-LS would like to invite self-nominations for service opportunities in committee membership, conference planning, and leadership.

Her dissertation, entitled “Are children really the poorer eyewitnesses: An analysis of counterintuitive developmental trends in eyewitness memory,” comprised a series of studies investigating the malleability of developmental trends in eyewitness memory and testing methods to improve witness recall. The reviewers were extremely impressed with the dissertation work. “The author strings together, elegantly, a series of multi-study manuscripts to review developmental trends in eyewitness memory.The author puts the work together thoughtfully and meaningfully. The work throughout is of high quality with rigorous methodology.” The originality of the research also came through: “From the formatting and organizational structure, to the examination of adolescents, there is a sense of novelty throughout.The author is pushing the field forward to investigate an old problem in a new vein.” In addition, the reviewers noted the substantial contribution of the research to both researcher and practitioner communities.  Dr. Brackmann completed her dissertation under the supervision of Dr. Merckelbach at Maastricht University and Dr. Granhag at the University of Gothenburg.Dr. Melissa Colloff is the 2nd place dissertation award winner. Her dissertation, entitled “Eyewitness  identification performanceon lineups for distinctive suspects,” investigated how the three lineup techniques for distinctive suspects influence eyewitness identification performance. She found that all three methods enable witnesses to confidently make accurate decisions, regardless of age. The research addresses an important and under-researched area through a progression of five studies. The reviewers noted that the research provides “a compelling case in favor of police employing any one of the three examined methods to maintain lineup fairness in cases involving a suspect with a distinct facial feature—an important applied contribution.” Dr. Colloff completed her dissertation under the supervision of Dr. Wade at Warwick University. Dr. Lauren Kois is the 3rd place dissertation award winner. Her dissertation, entitled “Criminal responsibility: A meta-analysis and study space,” systematically assessed predictors of criminal responsibility outcomes and identified significant study-level characteristics. Hers is the first meta-analysis in the area. The reviewers noted the dissertation was exceptionally strong in terms of presentation; the literature review was clear, the description of the meta-analysis process was meticulous, the findings were clear, and the discussion was thorough. They also noted the “strong contribution to identifying necessary lines of future research.” Dr. Kois completed her dissertation under the supervision of Dr. Chauhan at John Jay College, City University of New York.ON THE JOB OR POSTDOC MARKET? AP-LS JOB POSTINGSCheck out AP-LS's Job Postings Page for up-to-date information on available psychology-law positions here.Note that new positions are available.

No committee or task force shall have the authority of the Executive Committee in reference to amending, altering, or repealing the By-Laws; electing, appointing, or removing any officer of the Society; or amending or repealing any resolution of the Executive Committee; nor shall the appointment of any such committee and the delegation thereto of authority relieve the Executive Committee or any individual Executive Committee member of any responsibility imposed upon it by these By-Laws. In accordance with Article V, Section 7 of the By-Laws of the Association, all committees shall be subject to a review by the Association’s Board of Directors.\nExecutive Committee:\n\nThere shall be an Executive Committee of the Society, consisting of the President, the President-Elect, the Immediate Past-President, the Secretary, the Treasurer, the Divisional Representative(s) to the Council, three Members-at-Large, the newsletter editor, web page editor, the editors of the Society’s journals, the book series editor, and the chair of the Student Committee of the Society. The newsletter editor, the editor of the Society’s journals, the web page editor, and the book series editor are non-voting, ex-officio members of the Executive Committee. All chairs of Society committees are invited to attend Executive Committee meetings. Any vacancy occurring in the Executive Committee shall be filled by an appointment of the President, in consultation with the Executive Committee, to fill the unexpired term of the predecessor in that office.\nIn the conduct of Society business, the Executive Committee shall follow the procedural rules of Keesey’s Modern Parliamentary Procedure.\nFor voting purposes, a quorum shall consist of more than 50% of the voting members of the Executive Committee.\nThe Executive Committee shall set and amend Society policy by majority vote of a quorum. Because the Association is organized under the laws of the District of Columbia, the Association and its divisions, including the Society, cannot make decisions in settings other than those in which all of the board members (or Executive Committee members) can hear one another speak on the topic to be decided. As such, Society business should be carried out using face-to-face, telephone, or web-based meetings whenever possible. If the Society conducts a vote over email, unanimous approval is required; unanimous approval means that every eligible voting member must respond and everyone must agree.\nThe Executive Committee shall meet at least twice annually at the Association’s annual convention and the Society’s annual conference. Other meetings may be held on the call of the President, by consensus of the Secretary and Treasurer, or by consensus of a simple majority of the Executive Committee. All outgoing and incoming members of the Executive Committee should be present at the annual meeting of the Executive Committee (held in conjunction with the Association’s annual convention). With the consideration of new business, the President-Elect shall assume the office of President and the incoming Executive Committee shall take office. All members of the Executive Committee should also be present for the annual meeting of the Executive Committee held in conjunction with the Society’s annual conference.\nExecutive Committee members, other than the journal editors and book series editor, shall not be paid for their services to the Society. Executive Committee members will be reimbursed for travel to Society executive meetings according to the reimbursement policies then in effect. For good cause shown, and with the prior approval of the President, an Executive Committee member shall be considered present at a meeting, and eligible to vote, if participating by conference call or other remote means.\n\n\nArticle V: Activities\n\nThere shall be an annual Society conference at which scientific papers shall be presented and professional matters in the field of the Society’s interest shall be discussed. In addition, the Society will prepare programming as Division 41 for the annual Association convention.\nThe Society shall publish a newsletter and maintain a web page for purposes of coordinating and disseminating news relevant to the membership of the Society.\n\nAs a part of its mandate, the newsletter or web page shall publish the minutes of each Executive Committee meeting, the annual budget for the Society, announcements of the petition process as outlined in Article IV, Section 4(a) of these By-Laws, and final nominations for Society offices.\nThe editors of the newsletter and web page shall be nominated by the Nominations and Awards Committee, in consultation with the Publications and Communications Committee, such appointment subject to the approval of the Executive Committee. The editors shall be appointed to three-year terms and shall serve as ex-officio, non-voting members of the Executive Committee. By mutual consent of the newsletter editor or web page editor and the Executive Committee, the appointments may be extended for one additional three-year term, for a maximum of six years.\n\nThe Society shall publish journals with the goal of disseminating results of research and scholarly writing in the area of psychology and law. The Editor of a Journal shall be nominated by the Nominations and Awards Committee, in consultation with the Publications and Communications Committee and the (Outgoing) Editor. The Nominations and Awards Committee shall provide a list of two or three eligible candidates to the Executive Committee for consideration. The appointment of an Incoming Editor is subject to the approval of the Executive Committee and shall be made at least 18 months prior to the end of an Editor’s term. Beginning in January of an (outgoing) Editor’s final year, the appointed candidate serves as an Incoming Editor for a one-year period. An Incoming Editor receives all new submissions and is mentored by the Editor. Following the one-year term as an Incoming Editor, an Editor serves a six -year term. In the last of this six-year term, an Editor serves as a mentor to the new Incoming Editor.\nAn Editor assumes all Editor responsibilities during the six-year term. An Editor’s term is non-renewable but may be extended for up to two-years by majority vote of the Executive Committee. The extension should occur only under extenuating circumstances. An Editor may resign early through written notification to the President or may apply to the Executive Committee for a leave-of-absence. An Editor’s responsibilities include appointing the Associate Editors, Editorial Board, and Ad-Hoc Reviewers; soliciting manuscripts; managing the peer-review and publication processes; serving as a liaison with the publisher; reporting to the Executive Committee; representing the journal to all constituencies; and coordinating all other journal operations. An Editor takes a lead role in publication contract negotiations that occur during the Editor’s term (all contracts must be approved by the Executive Committee). An Editor manages the journal’s Editorial Budget and in so doing gives consideration to the needs of the Associate Editors and Incoming Editor. Editors shall serve as ex-officio, non-voting members of the Executive Committee. In the year in which there is both an Incoming and Outgoing Editor, the Outgoing Editor serves as the ex-officio, non-voting member of the Executive Committee.\nThe Society shall publish a book series with the goal of disseminating results of research and scholarly writing in the area of psychology and law. The editor of the book series shall be nominated by the Nominations and Awards Committee, in consultation with the Publications and Communications Committee, such appointment subject to the approval of the Executive Committee. The Editor shall be appointed for a five-year term and shall serve as a non-voting, ex-officio member of the Executive Committee. By mutual consent of the book series Editor and the Executive Committee, the appointment may be extended for an additional five-year term, for a maximum of ten years.\n\n\n\nArticle VI: Amendments\n\nAmendments to these By-Laws may be proposed by a majority vote of the Executive Committee or by a majority vote of the membership present at any annual meeting. Ratification of the proposed amendment requires a two-thirds majority of those of the membership voting, or by a two-thirds vote of those members attending any annual meeting. In either case, notice of the vote on the proposed By-Law Amendment must be published and made widely available to the membership prior to when the vote on the proposed By-Law Amendment occurs."

We stand strongly against racism, prejudice, and hate in all its forms. The tragic deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade, and countless other Black, Indigenous, and People of Color are unacceptable. These instances of horrific violence once again illustrate the profound systemic inequities and injustices toward marginalized and oppressed communities in the United States and around the world broadly and more specifically in our criminal justice, civil justice, legal, and carceral systems.\nWe recognize that racism does not occur in isolation, and its effects are heightened for people who also experience discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, social class, religion, immigration status, and other identities. Likewise, the negative effects of racism multiply across contexts. Recently, racial/ethnic disparities related to COVID-19, health care access, and the spread of COVID-19 in criminal and juvenile justice systems have magnified these profound inequities and injustices.\nWe believe that, through research, education, and training, better policies and practices can be developed to make the criminal justice, civil justice, legal, and carceral systems more equitable, just, and responsive to the needs of the communities in which they work.\nAs AP-LS members, we must engage in dialogue and action to create change within our society, our educational and legal institutions, and in our communities. We must engage in stronger efforts that support equity, inclusion, and just outcomes through our research, practice, teaching, and other professional activities. As a society, we seek to join other organizations to promote justice, put a spotlight on injustice, and condemn racism in all its forms. We stand together with Black, Indigenous, and Communities of Color and other oppressed groups and recommit to working together to ensure justice for all."

    "text": "Statement in Response to the Atlanta-area March 2021 Deaths\n\nSoon after the tragedy involving the death of George Floyd, AP-LS issued a statement in solidarity and to entrench our strong stand against hate in all forms. In response to the senseless killings of eight individuals in the Atlanta, Georgia area, largely because of the intersectionality of their gender and Asian heritage, AP-LS issues a second statement. AP-LS is committed to finding ways to combat prejudice and discrimination through the research, teaching, and practice of psychological science and law. For further resources and to see the statement issued by the Asian American Psychological Association {{<\n\nThe mission of the American Psychology-Law Society is to enhance well-being, justice, and human rights through the science and practice of psychology in legal contexts. We stand strongly against misogyny, racism, prejudice, and hate in all forms. On March 16, 2021, eight individuals, including six women of Asian heritage, were senselessly gunned down in the larger Atlanta, Georgia area. Their names are:  Soon Chung Park, Hyun Jung Grant, Suncha Kim, Yong Ae Yue, Delaina Ashley Yaun, Paul Andre Michels, Xiaojie Tan, and Daoyou Feng. These tragic deaths and countless others because of skin color, gender, and background—and their intersection—are unacceptable. Instances of violence and hate against Asian and Asian American/Pacific Islanders (AAPI) in particular have been on the rise; according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, Anti-Asian hate crime rose 149% in 2020, despite a 7% decrease in hate crime overall. \nMarch 8, 2021, a mere eight days before the Atlanta-area killings, we celebrated International Women's Day. The theme of this year's International Women's Day was \"Choose to Challenge.\" That is, the theme was to make the choice to challenge and call out bias and inequality against women when we see it—and to raise your right hand in support and commitment.\nAs a society, AP-LS chooses to raise our right hand for the individuals killed on March 16, 2021, especially those targeted because of their intersectional identity as Asian women. We raise our right hand against all forms of bias, discrimination, prejudice, and inequality. We recognize that prejudice does not occur in isolation, and its effects are heightened for people who experience discrimination based on gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, social class, religion, immigration status, and other identities—and the intersection of these. As AP-LS members, we must engage in dialogue and action to create change within our society, our educational and legal institutions, and in our communities. We must speak out against hate, violence, and inequality whenever and wherever it occurs. We must continue to engage in stronger efforts that support equity, inclusion, and just outcomes through our research, practice, teaching, and other professional activities. We are committed to working together to ensure justice for all."

The intent of this grant initiative is to advance a more interdisciplinary science that addresses understudied topics in psychology and law, as well as to broaden the discipline and amplify its practical impact. Proposed projects must investigate new or understudied topics in psychology and law, enhance the diversification of psychology and law research through novel theoretical or methodological approaches that are cross-disciplinary in nature, and/or promote the impact of research by considering novel populations or new problems or processes within the legal system; the proposed project is to include collaboration with practitioners or policymakers. Successful proposals are expected to involve projects with the potential to transform and impact the field by furthering novel lines of research inquiry and/or facilitating new cross-disciplinary collaborations.\nAs part of the AP-LS initiative toward a more inclusive society, grant applicatios that specifically address disadvantaged groups or understudied topic areas in psychology and law will be given preference. This includes funding scholars from traditionally underprivileged backgrounds.\nProposals may be submitted into one of two funding categories:\n\nSmall/Seed proposals ($1,000-$5,000 for a 12-month research period)\nLarge proposals ($15,000-$50,000 over a 12-18 month research period)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFunding should primarily support research activities and data collection efforts.

Projects requesting funding for payment of subjects from online sources (MTurk, Qualtrics panels, etc.) should provide justification for the amount of compensation being provided to subjects and account for any overhead costs charged by the site for using their services within the budget.\n\n\nThe Grants in Aid Committee will review and evaluate your project proposal based on the following criteria:\n\nRelevancy: The proposed research clearly addresses practice, research, and/or public policy directly relevant to the field of psychology and law.\nImpact: The proposed research will have meaning for the field of psychology and law, or contribute significantly to theory or knowledge on such topics.\nRationale: The proposed research includes a sound, thoughtful, and logical rationale for the proposed project; the logic of the proposal and literature review is clear and strong; the proposed method flows from the rationale itself.\nMethodology: The proposed research provides a complete and clear description of the sample, design, and procedure to be employed that demonstrates a sound research strategy appropriate to answer the research question(s).\nOpen Science: The proposed research employs practices that increase the transparency and accessibility of the science itself, such as (but not limited to): pre-registering hypotheses, making code and data easily accessible, or having a broad plan for disseminating findings.\nFeasibility: The proposed research can realistically be completed by students as outlined in the proposal based on the planned time, sample accessibility, materials, supports, and applicant’s research training and abilities.\nBudget: The requested budget items are critical to the completion of the project, clearly detailed, justified and within the scope of the identified items traditionally funded by the Grants-in-Aid Committee. If the student is paying online participants, the fees are adequately calculated and appropriate for the amount of time participants spend.\n\nStrong proposals will clearly articulate and support the relevancy, innovation, methodology, and feasibility of the research within the background and method of the proposal."

Recruit them into AP-LS’s AP program.\nThe purpose of the Access Path to Psychology and Law Experience (AP) Program is to increase diversity within psychology and law by increasing the pipeline of competitive graduate school applicants from groups that currently are underrepresented in the field, including racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBTQIA individuals, and disabled students.\nAP is designed to encourage faculty members to recruit students from underrepresented groups into their research labs. It provides financial support for the students to obtain meaningful research experience and attend the AP-LS conference as well as other opportunities for mentoring and development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe AP program will award up to $3,000 per student, depending on the length of the research experience. Recipients will be given a stipend of $1,200 per semester or $800 per quarter or summer for up to one year.\nIn addition, they will receive $100 for research expenses and up to $500 to attend the AP-LS conference.\nSix awards of $3,000 (i.e., for year-long experiences) or a larger number of smaller awards (i.e., for part-year experiences) will be given.\n\n\n\n\nFaculty are encouraged to identify promising undergraduate and terminal master’s degree students from underrepresented groups who are interested in psychology and law and have the potential to become competitive graduate applicants.\nUnderrepresented groups include, but are not limited to, racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBTQIA individuals, and physically disabled students.\nBecause the AP program is intended to expand the pipeline of qualified students from underrepresented groups, students should not be working with the faculty member in the proposed capacity prior to initiating the application process.\nStudents may already be working in the lab of a professor, but the proposal must consist of a new project.\nStudents in the AP program should be supervised primarily by faculty members rather than by graduate students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is the intention of the BRIDGE Committee that many of the students in the AP program will apply for graduate training related to psychology and law and ultimately become professionals in the field. The AP program primarily targets undergraduate students, but students from terminal master’s degree programs will also be considered.\n\n\n\n\nLink to Apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAward applications should include:\n\n\n\n\nA cover letter that provides contact information for both the student and the mentor\nA one-to-two page personal statement written by the student that addresses the following issues:\n\nstudent’s interest in the field of psychology and law, either in general or with respect to a particular issue in the field\nstudent’s educational and career goals\nstudent’s current qualifications and experiences for achieving those goals. All students should provide their current overall and psychology-specific GPAs.\nStudents also may discuss any personal characteristics or life experiences that are relevant to proposed project\n\nA two-to-three-page description of the proposed research experience\n\n\nStudents should discuss the research activities they will engage in with their mentors\nA description of the topic of the proposed research, providing as much detail about the project as well as the specific research tasks in which the student will engage. It is not necessary for students to complete an independent project, but they need to obtain meaningful experience that will help them be competitive for graduate school.\n\n\nThe research proposal should include the following, to the extent possible: - brief introduction/background to the project - brief description of the method, including participants, measures, and procedures\n\n\nA letter of support from the faculty member discussing the applicant’s potential for graduate work, interest in psychology and law, and ability to complete the proposed research experience. In addition, the faculty member should discuss his or her anticipated strategy for mentoring the student (e.g., amount of contact, training methods, plans for monitoring progress)\nA completed W-9 (U.S. citizen) or W-8 (noncitizen) tax form\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents in the AP program are required to:\n\nwork on research for approximately 10 hours per week for the duration of their research experience;\nparticipate in GRE classes and/or other development opportunities;\nattend an AP-LS conference;\nsubmit a proposal to present their research at an AP-LS conference or in the Div. 41 program of an APA conference;\nsubmit a summary of their research experience to the BRIDGE chair within one month of its completion;\ncorrespond with a secondary mentor from the BRIDGE Committee;\nparticipate in the ongoing assessment of the AP program.\n\nFaculty mentors in the AP program are required to:\n\nclosely supervise their students to ensure that they have a meaningful research experience that will make them more competitive for graduate school;\nhelp identify and facilitate opportunities for their students to participate in GRE classes and/or other development programs offered on their campuses (e.g., through the McNair program);\nassist their students in making a conference presentation about their research;\nparticipate in the ongoing assessment of the AP program"

Steadman, Edward Mulvey and John Monahan. Dr. Grisso wrote an article about that panel’s discussions for the Summer 2012 AP-LS News newsletter.\nYou can download a summary of that discussion below.\n Saleems Rules \n\n\nSaleem A. Shah, who was internationally known for his leadership in the field of law and mental health, died on Nov. 25, 1992, from injuries suffered when his automobile was struck by a drunken driver. Saleem was born on December 2, 1931, in Allahabad, India. After receiving a BA from Allahabad University, he came to the United States on a fellowship and earned his PhD in clinical psychology at Pennsylvania State University in 1957. He served as a graduate psychology intern at Spring Grove State Hospital, outside Baltimore, where he met his wife, Terry, with whom he had six daughters, all of whom survive him. After leaving Penn State, Saleem joined the Legal Psychiatric Services Division of the Department of Public Health in Washington, DC. He rose quickly to the post of chief psychologist and held this position until he joined the staff of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in 1966.\nSaleem remained at NIMH for the rest of his professional life. From 1968 to 1987, he was the chief of an extramural research program originally known as the Center for Studies of Crime and Delinquency and later as the Antisocial and Violent Behavior Branch. The scope of this program was extremely broad, covering such issues as the biology of antisocial behavior, delinquency, violence, and law and mental health studies. Saleem’s mastery of this entire interdisciplinary program soon made him a legend inside and outside NIMH, but his greatest interest was always the field of law and mental health, which he saw as encompassing the full range of interactions between the legal and mental health systems (see Law and Mental Health: Major Developments and Research Needs, 1991, with Bruce Sales).\nSaleem’s personal contributions to his field can perhaps be summed up as follows. He was committed, first and foremost, to the goal of achieving fair and equitable treatment for mentally disordered offenders and other persons whose mental status was at issue before the law. In his numerous scientific publications, he repeatedly drew attention to the tension between the therapeutic and the social control objectives of mental health laws and to the need for careful analysis of underlying constructs to establish a clear ethical and legal basis for policies and programs. As his writings on these topics became widely known, he was increasingly asked to give lectures and consultations in other countries, such as Germany, the former Soviet Union, and China.\nWhat Saleem could not do on his own, he accomplished through others. In 1968 he established law and mental health studies as a formal program priority for NIMH and became the guide and mentor for a new generation of scholars who by their empirical and theoretical work, much of it supported by NIMH, transformed the field of law and mental health studies: Thomas Grisso, John Monahan, Loren Roth, Bruce Sales, Henry Steadman, Linda Teplin, and David Wexler, to name but a few. Saleem also initiated an NIMH monograph series for the purpose of making current knowledge and research findings in law and mental health more readily available to policymakers and other potential users. More than 20 volumes were published during Saleem’s lifetime on topics such as clinical prediction of violent behavior, competency to stand trial, mental health services in local jails, and clinical treatment of violent persons.\nSaleem received many honors. He was the first recipient of the American Psychology-Law Society Award for Distinguished Contributions to Psychology and Law; he also received the Isaac Ray Award of the American Psychiatric Association for outstanding contributions in law and mental health and six U.S. government awards.\n\n\nThe Saleem Shah Award recognizes early career excellence and contributions to the field of psychology and law. The focus on the nominee’s contributions may be in any area of forensic practice, research or public policy.\nThe award is conferred annually at the AP-LS Annual Conference. Recipient receives a plaque and $2,000 ($1,000 from AP-LS and $1,000 from AAFP). The recipient also delivers the annual Saleem Shah Address at the AP-LS conference.\nThe award is co-sponsored by the American Academy of Forensic Psychology and decisions are made by a Committee (organized by AAFP) that includes joint representation from both AAFP and APLS.\n\n\nEligible individuals must have received a doctoral degree (Ph.D., Psy.D., M.D., or Ed.D.) or Juris Doctorate within the last six years.\n\nIf candidate has earned more than one eligible degrees, the latest degree is considered for this award.\n\n\n\nEmail nominations in PDF or Word format to the President-Elect of AAFP before midnight EST on November 30.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyone wishing to nominate a candidate should send:\n\n\n\n\nA nomination letter detatiling the nominee’s contributions to psychology and law\nA copy of the nominee’s vita\n\n\n\nSelf-nominations will not be considered.\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Past Recipients\n      \n    \n    \n      \n   \n      2020: Jeff Kukucka \n      2019: Stephane Shepherd \n      2018: Cynthia Najdowski \n      2017: Jessica Salerno \n      2016: Tess M.S.

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nApplications should be emailed directly to the Chair of the Practice Committee at award.practice.apls@gmail.com before annual November 1 deadline.\nAbout Practice CommitteeSubmit application\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptionBackgroundEligibilityHow to Apply\n\n\nThe AP-LS Practice Committee Award for Outstanding Clinical Mentoring to Eliminate Racial, Ethnic and Cultural (REC) Disparities Recognizes the substantive contributions of clinical mentors who educate and support emerging clinicians in psychology and law with a lens toward the elimination of REC disparities, and social justice.\nRecipients will receive a $500 cash award, a plaque to be presented at the annual AP-LS conference, and a feature article written by the practice committee members in the practice committee section of the AP-LS newsletter highlighting the recipients’ achievements and recommendations.\n\n\nREC disparities in the criminal justice system (CJS) necessitate that practicing psychologists working in the field of psychology and the law use their knowledge and experience to combat them. Practitioners are in a unique position to offer education, assessment, intervention and advocacy on issues of REC disparities, racism, and discrimination in the field of psychology and the law. However, a limited body of research, lack of practice guidelines on REC integration in forensic practice, and low representation of Black, Indigenous, People Of Color (BIPOC) professionals, limit such efforts. Mentorship of emerging practitioners in psychology and the law on such issues can bridge the gap of knowledge, application, and BIPOC representation in the field.\nThe AP-LS Practice Committee wants to recognize the substantive contributions of practitioner mentors who educate and support emerging clinicians in psychology and the law with a lens toward the elimination of REC disparities and social justice. For these purposes, we use Goldstein’s (2007) definition of the practice of psychology and the law: “The application of psychological research, theory, practice, and traditional and specialized methodology (e.g. interviewing, psychological testing, forensic assessment, and forensically relevant instruments) to provide information relevant to a legal question.”\nThe award for Outstanding Practitioner Mentoring to Eliminate Racial, Ethnic and Cultural (REC) Disparities in the Field of Psychology and the Law, will be conferred on a yearly basis. The recipient will receive a $500 cash award, a plaque to be presented at the annual AP-LS conference, and will be featured in an AP-LS newsletter article, written by the practice committee, highlighting the recipient’s achievements and recommendations to other practitioners. Highlighting the recipient’s mentorship practices and experiences can serve as a model for other professionals in the field of psychology and the law.\n\nReferences\nGoldstein, A.M. (2007).

It can also be so-called “informal mentorship” where the mentor has dedicated their personal time to assist and support emerging clinicians outside formal institutional affiliations (e.g. an African American forensic psychologist who regularly mentors other BIPOC early career psychologists in their area).\nExcellence in mentorship can take many shapes and forms. A common thread would be mentoring emerging clinicians, regardless of race or ethnicity, on using their specialized skills and knowledge as forensic psychologists to reduce REC disparities.\nThe practitioner’s mentorship has had a significant impact in the system in which they operate (e.g. supporting increased training opportunities on BIPOC issues, helping increase BIPOC representation in the field of psychology and the law, supporting antiracist professional identities for emerging forensic psychologists).\nSelf-nominations are encouraged; the candidate does not have to be an AP-LS member.\n\n\nThe nomination package should be converted into a PDF file and emailed directly to the chair of the award committee. Self-nominations are encouraged; the candidate does not have to be an AP-LS member.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNomination package (max 25 pages) should include:\n\n\n\n\nNominee’s statement (~1-2 pages) describing how the nominated psychologist meets the criteria for the award, their focus and approach to mentoring and how it centers BIPOC issues. For example, their support of BIPOC trainees/staff under their supervision and/or work with non-BIPOC trainees/staff on issues relevant to BIPOC populations in psychology and the law. It should also include their goals and accomplishments associated with the field of psychology and the law\nA copy of the nominee’s curriculum vitae\nA letter of support from a mentee (e.g. former or current) focusing on the impact the individual had in their professional development and understanding of BIPOC issues in FMH."

AP-LS encourages APA members, graduate and undergraduate students, and persons in related fields to consider joining.\nMembership Types\nThere are six categories of membership in AP-LS including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull\n\nIndividuals with a doctoral degree (Ph.D., Psy.D., M.D., or Ed.D.) in psych or related field or a Juris Doctorate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate\n\nInviduals with a master's degree in psych or related field or a terminal bachelors degree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly Career\n\nIndividuals within 10 years of receiving latest degree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFellows\n\nIndividuals granted Fellow Status (Full Members) or Distinguished Member status (Full Afilliates) by the society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational\n\nIndividuals who reside outside the United States with a relevant doctoral degree. All join as International Affiliates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent\n\nIndividuals currently enrolled in undergraduate or graduate program.
