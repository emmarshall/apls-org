    "text": "The final version of the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists, prepared by the AP-LS Committee on the Revision of the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology, was adopted by APA Council of Representatives on Aug. 3, 2011.\nThe guidelines originally appeared in American Psychologist and are available to download.\n Download Forensic Guidelines \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAPA has approved an extension of the current APA specialty Guidelines in Forensic Psychology through December 31, 2026.\n\n\nFor other professional guidelines from APA, go here\n\nApplicationDefinitions & TerminologyBackground & History\n\n\nThe Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists applies as follows:\nFor the purposes of these Guidelines, forensic psychology refers to professional practice by any psychologist working within any sub-discipline of psychology (e.g., clinical, developmental, social, cognitive) when applying the scientific, technical, or specialized knowledge of psychology to the law to assist in addressing legal, contractual, and administrative matters. Application of the Guidelines does not depend on the practitioner’s typical areas of practice or expertise, but rather on the service provided in the case at hand. These Guidelines apply in all matters in which psychologists provide expertise to judicial, administrative, and educational systems including, but not limited to, examining or treating persons in anticipation of or subsequent to legal, contractual, administrative, proceedings; offering expert opinion about psychological issues in the form of amicus briefs or testimony to judicial, legislative or administrative bodies; acting in an adjudicative capacity; serving as a trial consultant or otherwise offering expertise to attorneys, the courts, or others; conducting research in connection with, or in the anticipation of, litigation; or involvement in educational activities of a forensic nature.\n\n\nFor the purposes of these Guidelines:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory of the Guidelines\nThe previous version of the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists (Committee on Ethical Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists, 1991) was approved by the American Psychology-Law Society, Division 41 of the American Psychological Association, and the American Academy of Forensic Psychology in 1991. The current revision, now called the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology (referred to as Guidelines throughout this document), replace the 1991 Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists.\n\n\nRevision Process\nThis revision of the Guidelines was coordinated by the Committee for the Revision of the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology, which was established by the American Academy of Forensic Psychology and the American Psychology-Law Society (Division 41 of the American Psychological Association) in 2002 and operated through 2011. This Committee consisted of two representatives from each organization (Solomon Fulero, PhD, JD, Stephen Golding, PhD, ABPP, Lisa Piechowski, PhD, ABPP, Christina Studebaker, PhD) a Chairperson (Randy Otto, PhD, ABPP), and a liaison from APA Division 42 (Jeffrey Younggren, PhD, ABPP).\nThis document was revised in accordance with American Psychological Association Rule 30.08 and the APA policy document Criteria for the development and evaluation of practice guidelines (APA, 2001). The Committee posted announcements regarding the revision process to relevant electronic discussion lists and professional publications (i.e., Psylaw-L email listserve, American Academy of Forensic Psychology listserve, American Psychology-Law Society Newsletter).\nIn addition, an electronic discussion list devoted solely to issues concerning revision of the Guidelines was operated between December 2002 and July 2007, followed by establishment of an e-mail address in February 2008 (sgfp@yahoo.com). Individuals were invited to provide input and commentary on the existing Guidelines and proposed revisions via these means. In addition, two public meetings were held throughout the revision process at biennial meetings of the American Psychology-Law Society.\nUpon development of a draft that the Revisions Committee deemed suitable, the revised Guidelines were submitted for review to the Executive Committee of the American Psychology-Law Society and Division 41 of the American Psychological Association, and to the American Board of Forensic Psychology.\nOnce the revised Guidelines were approved by these two organizations, they were submitted to the American Psychological Association for review, commentary, and acceptance, consistent with the American Psychological Association’s Criteria for Practice Guideline Development and Evaluation (Committee on Professional Practice and Standards, 2001) and Rule 30-8. They were subsequently revised by the Revisions Committee and were adopted by the American Psychological Association Council of Representatives on [insert date here].\n\n\nDevelopers and Support\nThe Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology were developed by the American Psychology-Law Society (Division 41 of the American Psychological Association) and the American Academy of Forensic Psychology.\n\n\nCurrent Status\nThese Guidelines are scheduled to expire [insert date here]. After this date, users are encouraged to contact the American Psychological Association Practice Directorate to confirm that this document remains in effect.\nSGFP Guidelines originally adopted in 1991 (PDF, 64KB)\n Download \nJanuary 2006 Draft of the Revised SGFP Guidelines (PDF, 87KB)\n Download \nFebruary 2008 Draft of the Revised SGFP Guidelines (PDF, 99KB)\n Download \nSeptember 2008 Draft of the Revised SGFP Guidelines (PDF, 91KB)\n Download \nAugust 2010 Draft of the Revised SGFP Guidelines (PDF, 169KB)\n Download"

ECPs face a number of unique challenges and issues when making the transition from graduate study to professional life. More than ever, today’s ECPs are likely to struggle with juggling multiple roles. Challenges faced by ECPs include financial concerns or strains, meeting licensure requirements, developing a professional identify, obtaining tenure, and enhancement of health and wellness, among other issues (Green & Hawley, 2009).\nThe purpose of this award is to support AP-LS members who are ECPs in conducting research related to psychology and law. It is the committee’s desire that these awards are not limited only to members who are psychologists, but instead open to AP-LS members from all backgrounds.\nAward amounts\nFunding up to $5,000 per award is available. Funding should primarily support research activities and data collection efforts (e.g., equipment, participant payments, software data transcription, hourly payment for research assistants, and expenses incurred at sites away from the home institution while collecting data). Travel to conferences and salary expenses are not eligible costs. Funds for successful proposals will be awarded to the PI’s academic institution (via the institution’s Office of Sponsored Research or Foundation). No institutional indirect cost recovery will be permitted.\n\n\nTo receive an award:\n\nThe applicant must be an Early Career Professional, defined by APA as those within ten years of receiving their last degree.\nApplicants and any co-applicants must be classified as ECPs upon the application deadline for that year.\nApplicants may submit only one award proposal per funding cycle. In addition, to maximize the impact of the program, a strong preference will be given to those applicants who never have received an AP-LS ECP Grants-in-Aid.\nUnder exceptional circumstances, the committee may consider a second award. The possibility of a second award will be a rare occurrence, and the previous award must be completed prior to submitting a second proposal.\nProposals that represent “seed money” for larger projects and proposals that are for “standalone” projects will be accepted.\nApplicants are encouraged but not required to secure matched funding from employers to support the proposed research.\n\n\nAll applicants and any co-applicants must be active members of AP-LS.\n\n\nThese awards are not limited only to AP-LS members who are psychologists; they are open to members from all backgrounds.\nBut students are not eligible to receive an award.\n\n\n\nSubmit a complete proposal to the online portal by October 15 at 11:59 PST.\nClick to Apply\n\n\nProposal should include:\n\nPI and co-PI personal information and affiliations;\nstatus of the human subjects review for the project (approval must be obtained prior to disbursement of the award);\nexplanation regarding attempts to secure matched funding from employer (Contact the ECP committee with any questions);\nA 150-word abstract describing the proposed research;\nA five-page single-spaced project description with 1-inch margins and 12-pt Times New Roman font or similar. The description should include:\n\n\nStatement of the problem. A clear statement of the research problem and its significance to psychology and law;\nOverview of the relation of the problem to the state of the field: a concise overview of the relevant empirical literature, theoretical background, and/or law related to the research problem;\nProject method: a detailed description of the methodology and analytical strategies to be used;\nAnticipated contribution: a brief description of the significance of the project within the field of psychology and law.\n\n\nA reference list (does not count toward the page limit);\nA CV for each PI and co-PI contributing to the project, including a list of “significant collaborators” that includes dissertation and master’s thesis advisors, current and past students, co-authors within the last 5 years, editors who have edited a book in which you have a chapter published, and authors who have published in a book you have edited;\nA project timeline and a proposed budget that details anticipated expenditures and a budget justification that links the requested funds to the proposed activities (If the applicant has secured additional funding for the proposed research from another funding source, please provide an explanation of how the external funds will be used—additional funding is not required and is not considered among the evaluation criteria);\nSuggestions for at least five suggested reviewers for the project with expertise in the content area of the proposal: Suggested reviewers should not include anyone who might have a significant conflict of interest in reviewing the proposal (defined as “significant collaborators” in CV section). Please include the full name and email address of each suggested reviewer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep in mind\n\n\n\nAll project-related materials (i.e., abstract, description, timeline, budget) should be blinded. Failure to blind materials will disqualify the applicants from the program.\n\n\n\n\nApplications first will be reviewed by at least two external reviewers; proposals will be subject to blind review. After receiving external reviews, the ECP Committee will meet to evaluate the proposals and to make funding decisions. Both the external reviews and a panel summary will be provided to the applicant, regardless of award decision.\nIn evaluating each proposal, outside reviewers and the panel will evaluate and provide feedback about the intellectual merit and broader impacts of the project using the following criteria:\n\nProposal Quality: What is the quality of the proposed project? Is it methodologically rigorous? Is the method thorough and complete?\nProposal Contribution: What is the potential contribution of the proposal to the field of psychology and law? Does it have potential to contribute to advancing knowledge in the field?\nProposal Originality: Does the proposal present an original idea in psychology and law? Does the proposal use new or creative methods or viewpoints to address old problems?\nProposal Broader Impacts: Does the proposal have potential to benefit society or advance societal outcomes? (see NSF Broader Impact criteria for ideas of broader impacts to address)\nOverall rating: What is the overall assessment of the proposal? What is the funding recommendation?\n\n\n\nAwardees must submit yearly progress reports on Nov. 15 of each year until the project is complete.\nUpon completion of the project, awardees must submit an end-of-project report (to be displayed on our website) and must present the results of their research at either a subsequent AP-LS conference or in the division’s APA program (applicant’s choice)."

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nPlease be aware that students can only receive funding from one BRIDGE program/award per year.\nFor more information about the AP Program, please contact the program chair, Jason Lawrence.\nAbout BRIDGE CommitteeLink to Apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptionEligibilityHow to ApplyProgram Requirements\n\n\nDo you know a promising student from an underrepresented group who is interest in psychology and law, but not currently involved in research? Recruit them into AP-LS’s AP program.\nThe purpose of the Access Path to Psychology and Law Experience (AP) Program is to increase diversity within psychology and law by increasing the pipeline of competitive graduate school applicants from groups that currently are underrepresented in the field, including racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBTQIA individuals, and disabled students.\nAP is designed to encourage faculty members to recruit students from underrepresented groups into their research labs. It provides financial support for the students to obtain meaningful research experience and attend the AP-LS conference as well as other opportunities for mentoring and development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe AP program will award up to $3,000 per student, depending on the length of the research experience. Recipients will be given a stipend of $1,200 per semester or $800 per quarter or summer for up to one year.\nIn addition, they will receive $100 for research expenses and up to $500 to attend the AP-LS conference.\nSix awards of $3,000 (i.e., for year-long experiences) or a larger number of smaller awards (i.e., for part-year experiences) will be given.\n\n\n\n\nFaculty are encouraged to identify promising undergraduate and terminal master’s degree students from underrepresented groups who are interested in psychology and law and have the potential to become competitive graduate applicants.\nUnderrepresented groups include, but are not limited to, racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBTQIA individuals, and physically disabled students.\nBecause the AP program is intended to expand the pipeline of qualified students from underrepresented groups, students should not be working with the faculty member in the proposed capacity prior to initiating the application process.\nStudents may already be working in the lab of a professor, but the proposal must consist of a new project.\nStudents in the AP program should be supervised primarily by faculty members rather than by graduate students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is the intention of the BRIDGE Committee that many of the students in the AP program will apply for graduate training related to psychology and law and ultimately become professionals in the field. The AP program primarily targets undergraduate students, but students from terminal master’s degree programs will also be considered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAward applications should include:\n\n\n\n\nA cover letter that provides contact information for both the student and the mentor\nA one-to-two page personal statement written by the student that addresses the following issues:\n\nstudent’s interest in the field of psychology and law, either in general or with respect to a particular issue in the field\nstudent’s educational and career goals\nstudent’s current qualifications and experiences for achieving those goals. All students should provide their current overall and psychology-specific GPAs.\nStudents also may discuss any personal characteristics or life experiences that are relevant to proposed project\n\nA two-to-three-page description of the proposed research experience\n\n\nStudents should discuss the research activities they will engage in with their mentors\nA description of the topic of the proposed research, providing as much detail about the project as well as the specific research tasks in which the student will engage. It is not necessary for students to complete an independent project, but they need to obtain meaningful experience that will help them be competitive for graduate school.\n\n\nThe research proposal should include the following, to the extent possible: - brief introduction/background to the project - brief description of the method, including participants, measures, and procedures\n\n\nA letter of support from the faculty member discussing the applicant’s potential for graduate work, interest in psychology and law, and ability to complete the proposed research experience. In addition, the faculty member should discuss his or her anticipated strategy for mentoring the student (e.g., amount of contact, training methods, plans for monitoring progress)\nA completed W-9 (U.S. citizen) or W-8 (noncitizen) tax form\n\n\n\nLink to Apply\n\n\nStudents in the AP program are required to:\n\nwork on research for approximately 10 hours per week for the duration of their research experience;\nparticipate in GRE classes and/or other development opportunities;\nattend an AP-LS conference;\nsubmit a proposal to present their research at an AP-LS conference or in the Div. 41 program of an APA conference;\nsubmit a summary of their research experience to the BRIDGE chair within one month of its completion;\ncorrespond with a secondary mentor from the BRIDGE Committee;\nparticipate in the ongoing assessment of the AP program.\n\nFaculty mentors in the AP program are required to:\n\nclosely supervise their students to ensure that they have a meaningful research experience that will make them more competitive for graduate school;\nhelp identify and facilitate opportunities for their students to participate in GRE classes and/or other development programs offered on their campuses (e.g., through the McNair program);\nassist their students in making a conference presentation about their research;\nparticipate in the ongoing assessment of the AP program"

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nApplications should be emailed directly to the Chair of the Practice Committee at award.practice.apls@gmail.com before annual November 1 deadline.\nAbout Practice CommitteeSubmit application\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptionBackgroundEligibilityHow to Apply\n\n\nThe AP-LS Practice Committee Award for Outstanding Clinical Mentoring to Eliminate Racial, Ethnic and Cultural (REC) Disparities Recognizes the substantive contributions of clinical mentors who educate and support emerging clinicians in psychology and law with a lens toward the elimination of REC disparities, and social justice.\nRecipients will receive a $500 cash award, a plaque to be presented at the annual AP-LS conference, and a feature article written by the practice committee members in the practice committee section of the AP-LS newsletter highlighting the recipients’ achievements and recommendations.\n\n\nREC disparities in the criminal justice system (CJS) necessitate that practicing psychologists working in the field of psychology and the law use their knowledge and experience to combat them. Practitioners are in a unique position to offer education, assessment, intervention and advocacy on issues of REC disparities, racism, and discrimination in the field of psychology and the law. However, a limited body of research, lack of practice guidelines on REC integration in forensic practice, and low representation of Black, Indigenous, People Of Color (BIPOC) professionals, limit such efforts. Mentorship of emerging practitioners in psychology and the law on such issues can bridge the gap of knowledge, application, and BIPOC representation in the field.\nThe AP-LS Practice Committee wants to recognize the substantive contributions of practitioner mentors who educate and support emerging clinicians in psychology and the law with a lens toward the elimination of REC disparities and social justice. For these purposes, we use Goldstein’s (2007) definition of the practice of psychology and the law: “The application of psychological research, theory, practice, and traditional and specialized methodology (e.g. interviewing, psychological testing, forensic assessment, and forensically relevant instruments) to provide information relevant to a legal question.”\nThe award for Outstanding Practitioner Mentoring to Eliminate Racial, Ethnic and Cultural (REC) Disparities in the Field of Psychology and the Law, will be conferred on a yearly basis. The recipient will receive a $500 cash award, a plaque to be presented at the annual AP-LS conference, and will be featured in an AP-LS newsletter article, written by the practice committee, highlighting the recipient’s achievements and recommendations to other practitioners. Highlighting the recipient’s mentorship practices and experiences can serve as a model for other professionals in the field of psychology and the law.\n\nReferences\nGoldstein, A.M. (2007).

It can also be so-called “informal mentorship” where the mentor has dedicated their personal time to assist and support emerging clinicians outside formal institutional affiliations (e.g. an African American forensic psychologist who regularly mentors other BIPOC early career psychologists in their area).\nExcellence in mentorship can take many shapes and forms. A common thread would be mentoring emerging clinicians, regardless of race or ethnicity, on using their specialized skills and knowledge as forensic psychologists to reduce REC disparities.\nThe practitioner’s mentorship has had a significant impact in the system in which they operate (e.g. supporting increased training opportunities on BIPOC issues, helping increase BIPOC representation in the field of psychology and the law, supporting antiracist professional identities for emerging forensic psychologists).\nSelf-nominations are encouraged; the candidate does not have to be an AP-LS member.\n\n\nThe nomination package should be converted into a PDF file and emailed directly to the chair of the award committee. Self-nominations are encouraged; the candidate does not have to be an AP-LS member.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNomination package (max 25 pages) should include:\n\n\n\n\nNominee’s statement (~1-2 pages) describing how the nominated psychologist meets the criteria for the award, their focus and approach to mentoring and how it centers BIPOC issues. For example, their support of BIPOC trainees/staff under their supervision and/or work with non-BIPOC trainees/staff on issues relevant to BIPOC populations in psychology and the law. It should also include their goals and accomplishments associated with the field of psychology and the law\nA copy of the nominee’s curriculum vitae\nA letter of support from a mentee (e.g. former or current) focusing on the impact the individual had in their professional development and understanding of BIPOC issues in FMH."

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThe Saleem Shah Award is co-sponsored by the American Psychology-Law Society and the American Academy of Forensic Psychology (AAFP).\nNominations should be sent in PDF or Word format to the President-Elect of the AAFP\nAbout Saleem ShahSubmit Nomination\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistoryDescriptionEligibilityHow to Apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAt the 2012 AP-LS Conference there was a session titled:“Saleem’s Rules: Lessons in Mentoring, Knowing What’s Right, and Changing the World - Why AP-LS Created a Saleem Shah Award” with speakers Thomas Grisso, Henry J. Steadman, Edward Mulvey and John Monahan. Dr. Grisso wrote an article about that panel’s discussions for the Summer 2012 AP-LS News newsletter.\nYou can download a summary of that discussion below.\n Saleems Rules \n\n\nSaleem A. Shah, who was internationally known for his leadership in the field of law and mental health, died on Nov. 25, 1992, from injuries suffered when his automobile was struck by a drunken driver. Saleem was born on December 2, 1931, in Allahabad, India. After receiving a BA from Allahabad University, he came to the United States on a fellowship and earned his PhD in clinical psychology at Pennsylvania State University in 1957. He served as a graduate psychology intern at Spring Grove State Hospital, outside Baltimore, where he met his wife, Terry, with whom he had six daughters, all of whom survive him. After leaving Penn State, Saleem joined the Legal Psychiatric Services Division of the Department of Public Health in Washington, DC. He rose quickly to the post of chief psychologist and held this position until he joined the staff of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in 1966.\nSaleem remained at NIMH for the rest of his professional life. From 1968 to 1987, he was the chief of an extramural research program originally known as the Center for Studies of Crime and Delinquency and later as the Antisocial and Violent Behavior Branch. The scope of this program was extremely broad, covering such issues as the biology of antisocial behavior, delinquency, violence, and law and mental health studies. Saleem’s mastery of this entire interdisciplinary program soon made him a legend inside and outside NIMH, but his greatest interest was always the field of law and mental health, which he saw as encompassing the full range of interactions between the legal and mental health systems (see Law and Mental Health: Major Developments and Research Needs, 1991, with Bruce Sales).\nSaleem’s personal contributions to his field can perhaps be summed up as follows. He was committed, first and foremost, to the goal of achieving fair and equitable treatment for mentally disordered offenders and other persons whose mental status was at issue before the law. In his numerous scientific publications, he repeatedly drew attention to the tension between the therapeutic and the social control objectives of mental health laws and to the need for careful analysis of underlying constructs to establish a clear ethical and legal basis for policies and programs. As his writings on these topics became widely known, he was increasingly asked to give lectures and consultations in other countries, such as Germany, the former Soviet Union, and China.\nWhat Saleem could not do on his own, he accomplished through others. In 1968 he established law and mental health studies as a formal program priority for NIMH and became the guide and mentor for a new generation of scholars who by their empirical and theoretical work, much of it supported by NIMH, transformed the field of law and mental health studies: Thomas Grisso, John Monahan, Loren Roth, Bruce Sales, Henry Steadman, Linda Teplin, and David Wexler, to name but a few. Saleem also initiated an NIMH monograph series for the purpose of making current knowledge and research findings in law and mental health more readily available to policymakers and other potential users. More than 20 volumes were published during Saleem’s lifetime on topics such as clinical prediction of violent behavior, competency to stand trial, mental health services in local jails, and clinical treatment of violent persons.\nSaleem received many honors. He was the first recipient of the American Psychology-Law Society Award for Distinguished Contributions to Psychology and Law; he also received the Isaac Ray Award of the American Psychiatric Association for outstanding contributions in law and mental health and six U.S. government awards.\n\n\nThe Saleem Shah Award recognizes early career excellence and contributions to the field of psychology and law. The focus on the nominee’s contributions may be in any area of forensic practice, research or public policy.\nThe award is conferred annually at the AP-LS Annual Conference. Recipient receives a plaque and $2,000 ($1,000 from AP-LS and $1,000 from AAFP). The recipient also delivers the annual Saleem Shah Address at the AP-LS conference.\nThe award is co-sponsored by the American Academy of Forensic Psychology and decisions are made by a Committee (organized by AAFP) that includes joint representation from both AAFP and APLS.\n\n\nEligible individuals must have received a doctoral degree (Ph.D., Psy.D., M.D., or Ed.D.) or Juris Doctorate within the last six years.\n\nIf candidate has earned more than one eligible degrees, the latest degree is considered for this award.\n\n\n\nEmail nominations in PDF or Word format to the President-Elect of AAFP before midnight EST on November 30.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyone wishing to nominate a candidate should send:\n\n\n\n\nA nomination letter detatiling the nominee’s contributions to psychology and law\nA copy of the nominee’s vita\n\n\n\nSelf-nominations will not be considered.\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Past Recipients\n      \n    \n    \n      \n   \n      2020: Jeff Kukucka \n      2019: Stephane Shepherd \n      2018: Cynthia Najdowski \n      2017: Jessica Salerno \n      2016: Tess M.S.

The society is interested in publishing scholarly work that advances the field of psychology and law by contributing to its theoretical and empirical knowledge base. The series editor will consider proposals in any area of psychology and law. If you would like more information about submitting a proposal, please contact the book series editor, Monica Miller.\n\n\nFor all of the books within the prior series, please visit the Oxford University Press AP-LS book series page."
