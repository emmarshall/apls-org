We strongly encourage empirically based proposals, proposals that involve new and emerging topics within psychology and law, and proposals that incorporate historically marginalized or underrepresented populations. Proposals will be evaluated through a blind review process focused on intellectual merit, innovation, novelty, and integration of multiple aspects of the field.\nSpecial Consideration for Artificial Intelligence (AI) Submissions\nSpecial consideration will be given to proposals regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in psychology and law. AI is defined as technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, decision making, creativity, and autonomy. We are particularly interested in empirical studies addressing machine models, deep learning models, and large learning models (LLMs).\n\n\nAll proposals must be submitted on the conference website by  Wednesday, October 15, 2025, 11:59 pm PST\nVisit the Ex Ordo portal to register, submit your proposals, AND sign up as a reviewer!\n Register here\n\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about the conference, please contact the conference co-chairs at conference at ap-ls dot org  2026 AP-LS Conference Co-Chairs  Heath Hodges & Luna Filipović\n\n\n\nProposal Types & Submission Requirements\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSubmission requirements have been modified to be more convenient. Specifically, the 1,000-word summary requirement has been omitted for all submissions, except Symposia. In lieu of this, the word count for abstracts is a slightly larger (i.e., 400-500 words).\n\n\n\n\n\nSymposia\n\nSymposia: A 60-to-80-minute session with multiple presentations (i.e., papers) focused on a single topic. This includes an independent discussant/chair and a minimum of 3 papers and no more than 5 papers.\n\nPapers\n\nPapers: A paper is a presentation describing an individual research topic or piece of legal scholarship. Accepted papers are clustered into 60-minute sessions, with 3-4 papers in each session. Whenever possible, papers are organized into themed sessions.\n\nData-blitz\n\nData-blitz: A data-blitz is face-paced, 5-minute presentation (limited to 3 PowerPoint slides) covering a bite-sized piece of emerging psycho-legal research. Accepted proposals are clustered into 60-minute sessions, with approximately 10 data-blitz es in each session. Whenever possible, data-blitzes are loosely organized by topic.\n\nPosters\n\nPosters: A poster is a concise, visual summary of research or legal scholarship that is displayed on a large poster board (e.g., 4’ x 6’). Accepted posters are presented during one of two evening poster sessions, typically Friday and Saturday evening, during the conference. They are not organized by topic. While not required, we encourage presenters to adhere to the APA Convention Poster Instructions, including the use of the Better Poster format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall for Reviewers\n\nReviewers: Reviewers, including professional and graduate student reviewers, are invited for all content areas. Proposals will be distributed for review in late October. Reviews will be due in late November, prior to Thanksgiving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHotel Information\n\n Peppermill Resort Spa Casino\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Plan your trip  Map\n\n\n\n\nThe 2025 AP-LS Conference will be held at the Peppermill Resort Spa Casino"

    "text": "Welcome to Philadelphia!\n\n\n\nWe hope that you find the 2023 conference enriching, invigorating and collaborative. We are so excited to be in Philadelphia with all of you. Enjoy!\n\n\n\n2023 AP-LS Conference Co-Chairs Andrea Avila & Miko M. Wilford\n\n\n\n Mini Programs Internet COVID Precautions Fun RunContinuing Education (CE) For Presenters Preconference Workshops\n\n\n\nPrinted mini programs in lieu of full programs\nAs a step toward being greener and cutting down on costs as an organization, we decided to forego the printing of the full programs again this year. Instead, conference goers will receive printed mini programs.\nConference goers can refer to the schedule page or full program PDF or the conference program mobile app via their digital devices.\n\n\n\n\nWireless internet limitations in conference rooms\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nWhile those staying at the conference hotels will have complimentary internet access in their individual rooms, the actual conference rooms will not include wireless Internet access.\nThus, we recommend downloading the full program PDF and the conference mobile app prior to arriving in Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make the conference as safe as possible, we have tests available on demand to conference attendees.\nYou may contact office@ap-ls.org to arrange a contactless delivery of a COVID test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you are experiencing any COVID symptoms, do not visit any conference spaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore Philadelphia with colleagues on a 5k Fun Run, sponsored by the AP-LS Student Committee!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEET IN LOBBY OF THE CONFERENCE HOTEL AT 7:00 AM\n\n\n\nREFRESHMENTS WILL BE PROVIDED AFTER THE RACE\nCOST: $25.00\nFunds raised are used to support student committee conference awards\n Liability Waiver \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalo Alto University, Continuing & Professional Studies (CONCEPT) is pleased to offer CEs for the 2023 AP-LS conference. Numbered sessions in the schedule (p. 5 of the full program; see p. 20-22 for more detailed information) are expected to be eligible for CE credit; however, the certification process is still underway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nPlease check the Guidebook app when planning session attendance to confirm which sessions are eligible for CE credit.\nOur team will send an email to everyone who indicates they would like CEs on March 13th. All email communications will come from caps@paloaltou.eduPlease make sure this email is whitelisted on your email provider.\n\n\n\nWhat to expect at the conference\n\nTo receive CEs for a conference session, you must attend the session in its entirety. There will be sign-in/sign-out sheets for each session located at the back of the room; please print your full name & email address clearly to document your attendance at the session. This must be done for each CE session you attend.\nYou must complete an evaluation for each CE-eligible session you attend. The evaluation links for each day of the conference will be sent via email prior to the start of the first session. Please do not access these links until after each of the live conference sessions.\nYou will be able to download & save a PDF certificate upon completion of the evaluation. A copy will also be emailed to the email used at registration within 1-week of the close of the conference.\nIf you need support from CONCEPT for CE/Certificate needs, please visit the CONCEPT booth (between Franklin Hall and the escalators) during the conference.\n\n\n\n\n\nSymposia, Paper, and Data Blitz Sessions\nSymposia sessions are 80 minutes long and paper and data blitz sessions are 60 minutes long. All sessions will have an assigned chair who will be responsible for ensuring that approximately 10 minutes are reserved for questions. The remaining time should be divided evenly across all the scheduled presenters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nWhile Audio/Visual should be available in session rooms, note that Internet will not be. Thus, presenters need to ensure that their A/V content is stored on their computer and thumb drive so that it can be transferred to the session room computer and played locally.\n\n\n\n\nPosters\nPoster Sizing: The poster boards for mounting a poster are 4 ft (height) x 8 ft (width). Presenters are free to print any size poster that will fit within this space. Pushpins will be provided.\nPoster Board Numbering: Posters are numbered in the conference program so that the number for the poster indicates the correct board on which the poster should be hung. Poster presenters should refer to these numbers to identify the poster board to hang their poster.\n\n\n\nPre-conference Workshops will take place on Wednesday March 15.\nLearn more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2023 AP-LS Program Grid and Schedule is available to download and view online!\nConference Program"
