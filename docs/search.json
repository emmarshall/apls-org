Steadman, Edward Mulvey and John Monahan. Dr. Grisso wrote an article about that panel’s discussions for the Summer 2012 AP-LS News newsletter.\nYou can download a summary of that discussion below.\n Saleems Rules \n\n\nSaleem A. Shah, who was internationally known for his leadership in the field of law and mental health, died on Nov. 25, 1992, from injuries suffered when his automobile was struck by a drunken driver. Saleem was born on December 2, 1931, in Allahabad, India. After receiving a BA from Allahabad University, he came to the United States on a fellowship and earned his PhD in clinical psychology at Pennsylvania State University in 1957. He served as a graduate psychology intern at Spring Grove State Hospital, outside Baltimore, where he met his wife, Terry, with whom he had six daughters, all of whom survive him. After leaving Penn State, Saleem joined the Legal Psychiatric Services Division of the Department of Public Health in Washington, DC. He rose quickly to the post of chief psychologist and held this position until he joined the staff of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in 1966.\nSaleem remained at NIMH for the rest of his professional life. From 1968 to 1987, he was the chief of an extramural research program originally known as the Center for Studies of Crime and Delinquency and later as the Antisocial and Violent Behavior Branch. The scope of this program was extremely broad, covering such issues as the biology of antisocial behavior, delinquency, violence, and law and mental health studies. Saleem’s mastery of this entire interdisciplinary program soon made him a legend inside and outside NIMH, but his greatest interest was always the field of law and mental health, which he saw as encompassing the full range of interactions between the legal and mental health systems (see Law and Mental Health: Major Developments and Research Needs, 1991, with Bruce Sales).\nSaleem’s personal contributions to his field can perhaps be summed up as follows. He was committed, first and foremost, to the goal of achieving fair and equitable treatment for mentally disordered offenders and other persons whose mental status was at issue before the law. In his numerous scientific publications, he repeatedly drew attention to the tension between the therapeutic and the social control objectives of mental health laws and to the need for careful analysis of underlying constructs to establish a clear ethical and legal basis for policies and programs. As his writings on these topics became widely known, he was increasingly asked to give lectures and consultations in other countries, such as Germany, the former Soviet Union, and China.\nWhat Saleem could not do on his own, he accomplished through others. In 1968 he established law and mental health studies as a formal program priority for NIMH and became the guide and mentor for a new generation of scholars who by their empirical and theoretical work, much of it supported by NIMH, transformed the field of law and mental health studies: Thomas Grisso, John Monahan, Loren Roth, Bruce Sales, Henry Steadman, Linda Teplin, and David Wexler, to name but a few. Saleem also initiated an NIMH monograph series for the purpose of making current knowledge and research findings in law and mental health more readily available to policymakers and other potential users. More than 20 volumes were published during Saleem’s lifetime on topics such as clinical prediction of violent behavior, competency to stand trial, mental health services in local jails, and clinical treatment of violent persons.\nSaleem received many honors. He was the first recipient of the American Psychology-Law Society Award for Distinguished Contributions to Psychology and Law; he also received the Isaac Ray Award of the American Psychiatric Association for outstanding contributions in law and mental health and six U.S. government awards.\n\n\nThe Saleem Shah Award recognizes early career excellence and contributions to the field of psychology and law. The focus on the nominee’s contributions may be in any area of forensic practice, research or public policy.\nThe award is conferred annually at the AP-LS Annual Conference. Recipient receives a plaque and $2,000 ($1,000 from AP-LS and $1,000 from AAFP). The recipient also delivers the annual Saleem Shah Address at the AP-LS conference.\nThe award is co-sponsored by the American Academy of Forensic Psychology and decisions are made by a Committee (organized by AAFP) that includes joint representation from both AAFP and APLS.\n\n\nEligible individuals must have received a doctoral degree (Ph.D., Psy.D., M.D., or Ed.D.) or Juris Doctorate within the last six years.\n\nIf candidate has earned more than one eligible degrees, the latest degree is considered for this award.\n\n\n\nEmail nominations in PDF or Word format to the President-Elect of AAFP before midnight EST on November 30.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyone wishing to nominate a candidate should send:\n\n\n\n\nA nomination letter detatiling the nominee’s contributions to psychology and law\nA copy of the nominee’s vita\n\n\n\nSelf-nominations will not be considered.\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Past Recipients\n      \n    \n    \n      \n   \n      2020: Jeff Kukucka \n      2019: Stephane Shepherd \n      2018: Cynthia Najdowski \n      2017: Jessica Salerno \n      2016: Tess M.S.

Recipients will be given a stipend of $1,200 per semester or $800 per quarter or summer for up to one year.\nIn addition, they will receive $100 for research expenses and up to $500 to attend the AP-LS conference.\nSix awards of $3,000 (i.e., for year-long experiences) or a larger number of smaller awards (i.e., for part-year experiences) will be given.\n\n\n\n\nFaculty are encouraged to identify promising undergraduate and terminal master’s degree students from underrepresented groups who are interested in psychology and law and have the potential to become competitive graduate applicants.\nUnderrepresented groups include, but are not limited to, racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBTQIA individuals, and physically disabled students.\nBecause the AP program is intended to expand the pipeline of qualified students from underrepresented groups, students should not be working with the faculty member in the proposed capacity prior to initiating the application process.\nStudents may already be working in the lab of a professor, but the proposal must consist of a new project.\nStudents in the AP program should be supervised primarily by faculty members rather than by graduate students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is the intention of the BRIDGE Committee that many of the students in the AP program will apply for graduate training related to psychology and law and ultimately become professionals in the field. The AP program primarily targets undergraduate students, but students from terminal master’s degree programs will also be considered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAward applications should include:\n\n\n\n\nA cover letter that provides contact information for both the student and the mentor\nA one-to-two page personal statement written by the student that addresses the following issues:\n\nstudent’s interest in the field of psychology and law, either in general or with respect to a particular issue in the field\nstudent’s educational and career goals\nstudent’s current qualifications and experiences for achieving those goals. All students should provide their current overall and psychology-specific GPAs.\nStudents also may discuss any personal characteristics or life experiences that are relevant to proposed project\n\nA two-to-three-page description of the proposed research experience\n\n\nStudents should discuss the research activities they will engage in with their mentors\nA description of the topic of the proposed research, providing as much detail about the project as well as the specific research tasks in which the student will engage. It is not necessary for students to complete an independent project, but they need to obtain meaningful experience that will help them be competitive for graduate school.\n\n\nThe research proposal should include the following, to the extent possible: - brief introduction/background to the project - brief description of the method, including participants, measures, and procedures\n\n\nA letter of support from the faculty member discussing the applicant’s potential for graduate work, interest in psychology and law, and ability to complete the proposed research experience. In addition, the faculty member should discuss his or her anticipated strategy for mentoring the student (e.g., amount of contact, training methods, plans for monitoring progress)\nA completed W-9 (U.S. citizen) or W-8 (noncitizen) tax form\n\n\n\nLink to Apply\n\n\nStudents in the AP program are required to:\n\nwork on research for approximately 10 hours per week for the duration of their research experience;\nparticipate in GRE classes and/or other development opportunities;\nattend an AP-LS conference;\nsubmit a proposal to present their research at an AP-LS conference or in the Div. 41 program of an APA conference;\nsubmit a summary of their research experience to the BRIDGE chair within one month of its completion;\ncorrespond with a secondary mentor from the BRIDGE Committee;\nparticipate in the ongoing assessment of the AP program.\n\nFaculty mentors in the AP program are required to:\n\nclosely supervise their students to ensure that they have a meaningful research experience that will make them more competitive for graduate school;\nhelp identify and facilitate opportunities for their students to participate in GRE classes and/or other development programs offered on their campuses (e.g., through the McNair program);\nassist their students in making a conference presentation about their research;\nparticipate in the ongoing assessment of the AP program"

The intent of this grant initiative is to advance a more interdisciplinary science that addresses understudied topics in psychology and law, as well as to broaden the discipline and amplify its practical impact. Proposed projects must investigate new or understudied topics in psychology and law, enhance the diversification of psychology and law research through novel theoretical or methodological approaches that are cross-disciplinary in nature, and/or promote the impact of research by considering novel populations or new problems or processes within the legal system; the proposed project is to include collaboration with practitioners or policymakers. Successful proposals are expected to involve projects with the potential to transform and impact the field by furthering novel lines of research inquiry and/or facilitating new cross-disciplinary collaborations.\nAs part of the AP-LS initiative toward a more inclusive society, grant applicatios that specifically address disadvantaged groups or understudied topic areas in psychology and law will be given preference. This includes funding scholars from traditionally underprivileged backgrounds.\nProposals may be submitted into one of two funding categories:\n\nSmall/Seed proposals ($1,000-$5,000 for a 12-month research period)\nLarge proposals ($15,000-$50,000 over a 12-18 month research period)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFunding should primarily support research activities and data collection efforts.

    "text": "Statement on Racism, Prejudice and HateStatement in Response to the Atlanta-area March 2021 Deaths\n\n\nThe mission of the American Psychology-Law Society is to enhance well-being, justice, and human rights through the science and practice of psychology in legal contexts. We stand strongly against racism, prejudice, and hate in all its forms. The tragic deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade, and countless other Black, Indigenous, and People of Color are unacceptable. These instances of horrific violence once again illustrate the profound systemic inequities and injustices toward marginalized and oppressed communities in the United States and around the world broadly and more specifically in our criminal justice, civil justice, legal, and carceral systems.\nWe recognize that racism does not occur in isolation, and its effects are heightened for people who also experience discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, social class, religion, immigration status, and other identities. Likewise, the negative effects of racism multiply across contexts. Recently, racial/ethnic disparities related to COVID-19, health care access, and the spread of COVID-19 in criminal and juvenile justice systems have magnified these profound inequities and injustices.\nWe believe that, through research, education, and training, better policies and practices can be developed to make the criminal justice, civil justice, legal, and carceral systems more equitable, just, and responsive to the needs of the communities in which they work.\nAs AP-LS members, we must engage in dialogue and action to create change within our society, our educational and legal institutions, and in our communities. We must engage in stronger efforts that support equity, inclusion, and just outcomes through our research, practice, teaching, and other professional activities. As a society, we seek to join other organizations to promote justice, put a spotlight on injustice, and condemn racism in all its forms. We stand together with Black, Indigenous, and Communities of Color and other oppressed groups and recommit to working together to ensure justice for all.\n\n\n\nSoon after the tragedy involving the death of George Floyd, AP-LS issued a statement in solidarity and to entrench our strong stand against hate in all forms. In response to the senseless killings of eight individuals in the Atlanta, Georgia area, largely because of the intersectionality of their gender and Asian heritage, AP-LS issues a second statement. AP-LS is committed to finding ways to combat prejudice and discrimination through the research, teaching, and practice of psychological science and law. For further resources and to see the statement issued by the Asian American Psychological Association \n\nThe mission of the American Psychology-Law Society is to enhance well-being, justice, and human rights through the science and practice of psychology in legal contexts. We stand strongly against misogyny, racism, prejudice, and hate in all forms. On March 16, 2021, eight individuals, including six women of Asian heritage, were senselessly gunned down in the larger Atlanta, Georgia area.\nTheir names are: Soon Chung Park, Hyun Jung Grant, Suncha Kim, Yong AeYue, Delaina Ashley Yaun, Paul Andre Michels, Xiaojie Tan, and Daoyou Feng.These tragic deaths and countless others because of skin color, gender, and background—and their intersection—are unacceptable. Instances of violence and hate against Asian and Asian American/Pacific Islanders (AAPI) in particular have been on the rise; according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, Anti-Asian hate crime rose 149% in 2020, despite a 7% decrease in hate crime overall.\nMarch 8, 2021, a mere eight days before the Atlanta-area killings, we celebrated International Women's Day. The theme of this year's International Women's Day was \"Choose to Challenge.\" That is, the theme was to make the choice to challenge and call out bias and inequality against women when we see it—and to raise your right hand in support and commitment.\nAs a society, AP-LS chooses to raise our right hand for the individuals killed on March 16, 2021, especially those targeted because of their intersectional identity as Asian women. We raise our right hand against all forms of bias, discrimination, prejudice, and inequality. We recognize that prejudice does not occur in isolation, and its effects are heightened for people who experience discrimination based on gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, social class, religion, immigration status, and other identities—and the intersection of these.As AP-LS members, we must engage in dialogue and action to create change within our society, our educational and legal institutions, and in our communities. We must speak out against hate, violence, and inequality whenever and wherever it occurs. We must continue to engage in stronger efforts that support equity, inclusion, and just outcomes through our research, practice, teaching, and other professional activities. We are committed to working together to ensure justice for all."

Any vacancy occurring in the Executive Committee shall be filled by an appointment of the President, in consultation with the Executive Committee, to fill the unexpired term of the predecessor in that office.\nIn the conduct of Society business, the Executive Committee shall follow the procedural rules of Keesey’s Modern Parliamentary Procedure.\nFor voting purposes, a quorum shall consist of more than 50% of the voting members of the Executive Committee.\nThe Executive Committee shall set and amend Society policy by majority vote of a quorum. Because the Association is organized under the laws of the District of Columbia, the Association and its divisions, including the Society, cannot make decisions in settings other than those in which all of the board members (or Executive Committee members) can hear one another speak on the topic to be decided. As such, Society business should be carried out using face-to-face, telephone, or web-based meetings whenever possible. If the Society conducts a vote over email, unanimous approval is required; unanimous approval means that every eligible voting member must respond and everyone must agree.\nThe Executive Committee shall meet at least twice annually at the Association’s annual convention and the Society’s annual conference. Other meetings may be held on the call of the President, by consensus of the Secretary and Treasurer, or by consensus of a simple majority of the Executive Committee. All outgoing and incoming members of the Executive Committee should be present at the annual meeting of the Executive Committee (held in conjunction with the Association’s annual convention). With the consideration of new business, the President-Elect shall assume the office of President and the incoming Executive Committee shall take office. All members of the Executive Committee should also be present for the annual meeting of the Executive Committee held in conjunction with the Society’s annual conference.\nExecutive Committee members, other than the journal editors and book series editor, shall not be paid for their services to the Society. Executive Committee members will be reimbursed for travel to Society executive meetings according to the reimbursement policies then in effect. For good cause shown, and with the prior approval of the President, an Executive Committee member shall be considered present at a meeting, and eligible to vote, if participating by conference call or other remote means.\n\n\nArticle V: Activities\n\nThere shall be an annual Society conference at which scientific papers shall be presented and professional matters in the field of the Society’s interest shall be discussed. In addition, the Society will prepare programming as Division 41 for the annual Association convention.\nThe Society shall publish a newsletter and maintain a web page for purposes of coordinating and disseminating news relevant to the membership of the Society.\n\nAs a part of its mandate, the newsletter or web page shall publish the minutes of each Executive Committee meeting, the annual budget for the Society, announcements of the petition process as outlined in Article IV, Section 4(a) of these By-Laws, and final nominations for Society offices.\nThe editors of the newsletter and web page shall be nominated by the Nominations and Awards Committee, in consultation with the Publications and Communications Committee, such appointment subject to the approval of the Executive Committee. The editors shall be appointed to three-year terms and shall serve as ex-officio, non-voting members of the Executive Committee. By mutual consent of the newsletter editor or web page editor and the Executive Committee, the appointments may be extended for one additional three-year term, for a maximum of six years.\n\nThe Society shall publish journals with the goal of disseminating results of research and scholarly writing in the area of psychology and law. The Editor of a Journal shall be nominated by the Nominations and Awards Committee, in consultation with the Publications and Communications Committee and the (Outgoing) Editor. The Nominations and Awards Committee shall provide a list of two or three eligible candidates to the Executive Committee for consideration. The appointment of an Incoming Editor is subject to the approval of the Executive Committee and shall be made at least 18 months prior to the end of an Editor’s term. Beginning in January of an (outgoing) Editor’s final year, the appointed candidate serves as an Incoming Editor for a one-year period. An Incoming Editor receives all new submissions and is mentored by the Editor. Following the one-year term as an Incoming Editor, an Editor serves a six -year term. In the last of this six-year term, an Editor serves as a mentor to the new Incoming Editor.\nAn Editor assumes all Editor responsibilities during the six-year term. An Editor’s term is non-renewable but may be extended for up to two-years by majority vote of the Executive Committee. The extension should occur only under extenuating circumstances. An Editor may resign early through written notification to the President or may apply to the Executive Committee for a leave-of-absence. An Editor’s responsibilities include appointing the Associate Editors, Editorial Board, and Ad-Hoc Reviewers; soliciting manuscripts; managing the peer-review and publication processes; serving as a liaison with the publisher; reporting to the Executive Committee; representing the journal to all constituencies; and coordinating all other journal operations. An Editor takes a lead role in publication contract negotiations that occur during the Editor’s term (all contracts must be approved by the Executive Committee). An Editor manages the journal’s Editorial Budget and in so doing gives consideration to the needs of the Associate Editors and Incoming Editor. Editors shall serve as ex-officio, non-voting members of the Executive Committee. In the year in which there is both an Incoming and Outgoing Editor, the Outgoing Editor serves as the ex-officio, non-voting member of the Executive Committee.\nThe Society shall publish a book series with the goal of disseminating results of research and scholarly writing in the area of psychology and law. The editor of the book series shall be nominated by the Nominations and Awards Committee, in consultation with the Publications and Communications Committee, such appointment subject to the approval of the Executive Committee. The Editor shall be appointed for a five-year term and shall serve as a non-voting, ex-officio member of the Executive Committee. By mutual consent of the book series Editor and the Executive Committee, the appointment may be extended for an additional five-year term, for a maximum of ten years.\n\n\n\nArticle VI: Amendments\n\nAmendments to these By-Laws may be proposed by a majority vote of the Executive Committee or by a majority vote of the membership present at any annual meeting. Ratification of the proposed amendment requires a two-thirds majority of those of the membership voting, or by a two-thirds vote of those members attending any annual meeting. In either case, notice of the vote on the proposed By-Law Amendment must be published and made widely available to the membership prior to when the vote on the proposed By-Law Amendment occurs."

For example, we provide multiple grants opportunities and recognize members through a range of awards for teaching, research and mentorship. We also hold an Annual Conference, participate in the APA Annual Convention, have an active book series, and are the home for our flagship journal, Law and Human Behavior.\nOne of our most important resources is our incredibly active Student Committee. The Student Committee oversees a range of resources and funding opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and Early Career Professionals. For those of you who may be new to the organization, we have a series of short videos that were developed by our Broadening Representative Inclusion, Diversity, and Global Equity, or BRIDGE Committee (formerly our Minority Affairs Committee). Our BRIDGE Committee is also the steward of several awards and grants that align with our organizational commitment to goals centered around diversity, equity, and inclusion.\nAs you navigate our webpages, I hope you’ll find the many resources available for research, education and teaching, and careers in psychology and law. In addition, to keep abreast of the latest news in psychology and law, check out our monthly newsletter.\nAP-LS is a dynamic, diverse and multifaceted organization, and we are committed to our vision and mission through our values: the pursuit of excellence, knowledge and application based on methods of science, outstanding service to our members and to society, values of social justice, diversity, and inclusion, and ethical action in all we do.

Much of the meeting was focused on organizational change, inclusivity, and enhancing Council’s effectiveness as a policy-making body.\nTo read more about this meeting, please click here.\nAPA CONVENTION\nWe are excited about Division 41’s APA programming lineup, but safety comes first. In this time of uncertainty, we are following recent COVID-19 developments and associated public health concerns closely. As of newsletter “press time” 3/24/2020, the APA Convention is still scheduled for August 6-9 in Washington, DC. You can monitor convention news here, although we will be sure to update Division 41 membership if convention plans should change.\nNEWSLETTER EDITOR POSITION\nAP-LS is seeking applications for the position of Newsletter Editor, who has responsibility for publishing the AP-LS Newsletter on or about the first day of each month. The 3-year term begins in August, 2020. This is a non-voting appointment on the AP-LS Executive Committee. Each month, the Editor solicits news submissions from the AP-LS leadership. The Editor will work closely with the Associate Editor, Leah Georges, who coordinates regular column submissions from content editors (i.e., Research Briefs, Legal Update, Expert Opinion, Teaching in Psych & Law, Advances in Psych & Law). A modest annual budget provides for a paid Student Assistant Editor support position. Interested individuals are encouraged to contact the outgoing Editor Marc Patry to discuss the position.\nTo apply, please send a cover letter and Curriculum Vita to Chair of the Publications and Communications Committee, Brad McAuliff: bradley.mcauliff@csun.edu. The application deadline is May 15.\nLEGAL UPDATE: PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENTS IN LEGAL CONTEXTS: ARE COURTS KEEPING “JUNK SCIENCE” OUT OF THE COURTROOM?\nPsychological tests, tools, and instruments play an increasingly significant role in determining the outcome of legal cases. Yet major investigations have revealed that courts routinely admit evidence with poor or unknown scientific foundations (e.g., National Research Council, 2009; Saks & Koehler, 2005).This project evaluates both the scientific basis of psychological assessment tools and the courts’ evaluation of them.\nThis article is abridged by Christopher Slobogin, JD, LLM from the original recently published in Psychological Science in the Public Interest.\nTo read this column, please click here.\n2019 DISSERTATION AWARD WINNERS\nCongratulations to our 2019 Dissertation Award Winners!!\nFirst Place:\nChristine Shahan Brugh from North Carolina State University, advised by Joseph Simons-Rudolph & Sarah L. Desmarais\nTitle of Dissertation:\nHeterogeneity across terrorism contexts and actors: Improving the evidence base supporting counterterrorism strategy\nAbstract: Research on terrorism has grown vastly since the September 11th attacks, yet the field still grapples with who is likely to perpetrate terrorist acts and how to prevent terrorist violence (Desmarais, Simons-Rudolph, Brugh, Schilling, & Hoggan, 2017). As the field has developed, consensus among researchers has moved from a “one-size-fits all” approach to an understanding that terrorism involvement must be studied within individual differences, community contexts, and sociopolitical circumstances (LaFree & Freilich, 2017). Thus, this dissertation examined heterogeneity across actors and contexts by summarizing the extant literature on terrorism, studying terrorism-involved women, and comparing U.S. and European lone actor terrorists.\nSecond Place:\nDylan T. Gatner from Simon Fraser University, advised by Kevin Douglas\nTitle of Dissertation: How much does that cost? Examining the economic costs of crime in North America attributable to people with psychopathic personality disorder\nAbstract: Few works have quantified the social burden of psychopathic personality disorder (PPD). As such, the economic costs of crime attributable to PPD were examined. First, a top-down societal study considered PPD prevalence, offending rates, and national crime costs to produce estimates for the US, UK, and Canada. PPD resulted in staggeringly high crime costs in the US (simulated $678–$1,276 billion) and Canada (simulated $33–$42 billion). The UK produced modest costs (£4.77 billion). Second, among Canadian federal offenders (n=188), higher PPD traits were predictive of prospective crime costs. Clinical and policy implications for PPD treatment and research were discussed.\nThird Place:\nAlicia Nijdam-Jones from Fordham University, advised by Barry Rosenfeld\nTitle of dissertation: Cross-cultural violence risk assessment: Adapting risk assessment for institutional violence among criminal offenders in Mexico\nAbstract: This prospective study investigated the utility of a culturally adapted violence risk assessment measure (HCR-20V3) and its predictive validity among a sample of 114 male offenders in a Mexico City prison. The study findings showed that the culturally adapted HCR-20V3 was able to predict institutional violence with a high degree of accuracy (AUC = .77). Additionally, several culturally relevant risk factors (e.g., machismo attitudes, indirect and direct violence exposure, and familismo) significantly predicted institutional violence. The results suggest that culture may play an important role in understanding and estimating violence risk. Future research and clinical implications are discussed.\n\nUPCOMING FUNDING ALERT: AP-LS EARLY CAREER PROFESSIONAL GRANT-IN-AID CALL FOR PROPOSALS\nThe American Psychology-Law Society Committee on Early Career Professionals funds annually several grants of up to $5,000. The purpose of the award is to support AP-LS members who are within 7 years of receiving their last degree to conduct research related to psychology and law.\nDetails about the purpose of the award, eligibility, and application instructions are available on the AP-LS website, or you can click here.\nThe deadline is October 15, 2020. Applications should be submitted to aplsecpgrant@gmail.com.\nPlease contact the ECP Committee Chair, Jennifer Perillo, Ph.D., at aplsecpgrant@gmail.com with any questions.\n\n\nAP-LS AWARD FOR BEST UNDERGRADUATE PAPER\nRecognizes an outstanding undergraduate research paper focused on the interdisciplinary study of psychology and law.\nDeadline: June 30, 2020.\nTo be eligible for an award, the student must be the major contributor to a project on a topic relevant to psychology and law (i.e., the student had primary responsibility for initiating and conducting the project even though the project will usually be conducted under the supervision of a mentor). Data collection should be complete. Winners will be encouraged to submit their work for presentation at the AP-LS Conference (as first authors). Students may submit their work during their first post-undergraduate year as long as the work was conducted during their undergraduate career.\nFor more information, please click here.\n\n\nON THE JOB OR POSTDOC MARKET?

CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN FORENSIC ASSESSMENTS\nPresenters: Sheila Santiago Schmitt, PsyD; Monique Mendez-Timmons, PsyD; Yenys Castillo, PhD\nFriday, March 26, 2021 01:00 to 04:30 PM (ET)\nCE Credits: 3.5\nIntermediate skill level: Ethnic minorities have historically been overrepresented in the criminal justice system: yet, consideration of cultural and individual differences is seldom incorporated in forensic assessments. This lack of attention to cultural differences creates an unnecessary burden on the criminal and mental health system, as ethnic and individual differences are often pathologized as mental illness, and people of color are unnecessarily institutionalized. The purpose of this workshop is to provide an overview of how to incorporate cultural and individual differences in forensic assessments in order to enhance the efficacy of these evaluations, in accordance with forensic and diversity guidelines provided by the American Psychological Association. The workshop involves how to incorporate intersectionality using the “ADDRESSING” model by Pamela Hays (1996, 2008, 2016) to facilitate the understanding of individuals’ complexities. Examples from various types of forensic assessments (e.g., competency, risk, and death penalty assessments) will be reviewed to demonstrate how the ADDRESSING model can be used to consider cultural factors in informing the process of forensic evaluation, from the onset of the data collection process to providing the final psycholegal opinion.\nRegistration is required, register here.\nThe deadline to register is March 21, 2021. You will receive an email with a link to join the webinar one day before.\nWe look forward to you joining us!

Regents of the University of Californiain 1976, courts have taken myriad approaches to defining a therapist’s duty to protect a potential victim from a potentially violent client. In July 2020, inMaas v. UPMC Presbyterian Shadyside, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court broadened the definition of “readily identifiable victim” under Pennsylvania’s version ofTarasoffto include an unnamed neighbor in a 40-unit apartment building.

Amanda Zelechoski and Lindsay Malloy launched Pandemic Parenting, a web platform designed to share science-based resources with parents in a free and accessible way, with the overarching goal of helping to mitigate some of these consequences for families. Since then, they have hosted 12 webinars on a variety of relevant and urgent issues for parents who are navigating this ongoing and unprecedented crisis, as well as developed additional resources, blogs, videos, and media appearances to translate and disseminate information to parents in real time. In this webinar, brought to you by the AP-LS Professional Development of Women Committee (PDW), the co-founders of Pandemic Parenting will discuss the self-doubt, anxiety, and uncertainty that often accompanies pandemic parenting, especially for women, and strategies for overcoming it. They will also discuss some of the benefits and challenges associated with \"giving psychology away\" directly to parents and those who care for children. As a critical aspiration of many American Psychology-Law Society members and the field generally, they will share what they have learned about knowledge translation in less traditional formats through this Pandemic Parenting endeavor.

Batastini, Ph.D.& Robert Morgan, Ph.D.\nCE Credits: 3\nSkill level: Intermediate\nThe use and consequences of seclusion (e.g., restrictive housing, segregation) remains a widely debated and contentious topic in forensic and criminal justice settings. Unfortunately, the availability of mental health services is limited due to higher safety and security restrictions, and interventions that uniquely target the needs of this population are lacking.Stepping Up, Stepping Outwas developed to better serve populations in or at-risk for seclusion, as well as unit staff and administrators, particularly in institutions with fewer resources. The primary goals of this workshop are to (1) provide greater clarity over the ethical, legal, and scholarly debates surrounding segregation practices in the U.S., (2) introduce a novel and flexible intervention for reducing mental and behavioral health risks, and (3) promote a philosophy that all work must be empirical work by emphasizing ongoing and institution-specific program evaluations. This workshop will also focus on how the program can be adapted to accommodate the needs of various subgroups of segregated persons (e.g., serious mental illness, cognitive impairment, women). To facilitate a richer discussion around program implementation, attendees will also be encouraged to share experiences from their respective institutions as related to their work on restrictive units.\nRegistration is required, please register here!\nThe deadline to register is April 17.

Masked reviewers noted, “this dissertation truly does address a blank spot in our understanding and practice.” Reviewers were also impressed by the “extremely thorough and rigorous in the details of their methodology” and noted, “The development of a new risk assessment instrument that could play a role in predicting a common, harmful type of behavior—adolescent IPV—for which no existing instrument exists presents a significant contribution.” Dr. Shaffer-McCuish completed this dissertation under supervision of Dr. Kevin Douglas & Dr. Jodi Viljoen.\nAbstract: Despite the proliferation of risk assessment instruments in professional practice, there is no risk assessment tool to evaluate the risk of intimate partner violence (IPV) among adolescents. Thus, inthis dissertation, the utility of four widely used risk assessment tools, the SAVRY, YLS/CMI, PCL:YV, and SARA-V3, for evaluating adolescent IPV risk was examined. The findings suggest that using existingtools to evaluate and manage adolescent IPV risk might be problematic. This dissertation concludes with a discussion of the steps being taken to adapt the SARA-V3 for use with adolescents and implications for research, policy, and practice.\nDr. Alejandra de la Fuente Vilar(Maastricht University) received Second Place for her dissertation, A Broken Tandem: Understanding Lack of Witness Cooperation in the Interview Room. Masked reviewers noted about this dissertation, “Importantly, it highlighted the limited effectiveness of the evidence-based techniques for interviewing uncooperative witnesses.” Reviewers were impressed by the overall design, noting, “The archival analysis was strong, with clear checks for quality. The experiments are well-designed and executed.” Dr. de la Fuente Vilar completed this dissertation under supervision of Dr. Robert Hoselenberg.\nAbstract: Some witnesses are unwilling to cooperate in police investigations. Findings in this PhD dissertation, using archival, survey and experimental data, indicate that lack of cooperation is detrimental to eliciting accurate witness accounts in police interviews. Specifically, lack of witness cooperation reduces information disclosure by the interviewee. Furthermore, lack of witness cooperation can challenge the use of effective interviewing techniques, especially if interviewers are insufficiently trained, which in turn jeopardises the quality of witness evidence. Practitioners need to follow an information-gathering and rapport-based interviewing approach to promote cooperation. In addition, developing and testing specialised techniques to interview uncooperative witnesses is needed.\nDr. Adele Quigley-McBride(Iowa State University), received Third Place for her dissertation, The repeated-suspect effect: What is the effect of repeated identification attempts on eyewitness accuracy and the original memory for the culprit? Masked reviewers noted, “This thesis would make a good contribution to practice – informing police agencies about the problems with multiple identification procedures for the same suspect, and considering the memory of the real culprit, which has not often been considered.” Reviewers were impressed by the “well-designed and executed” experiments. Dr. Quigley-McBride completed this dissertation under supervision of Dr. Gary Wells.\nAbstract: Multiple identification procedures containing the same suspect can result in eyewitness identification errors—eyewitnesses may identify innocent people or report higher certainty after seeing the same suspect multiple times (therepeated-suspect effect). In two studies, we showed that a previous, biased lineup and more than one previous lineup containing an innocent suspect exacerbated the repeated-suspect effect. We also investigated the role of recognition memory and source monitoring in these identification errors. Experiment 2 demonstrated the often-underappreciated role of social influence in eyewitness errors—participants reported that the physical presence of the experimenter during the task influenced them in repeated-suspect conditions.\n\n\n2021 DISSERTATION AWARD COMPETITION\nWe are accepting submissions for the 2021 Dissertation Award Competition.

Since then, many of us continue to struggle with how best to acknowledge the importance of race in our evaluees’ lives. In the spirit of anti-racist work, we offer some suggestions and ideas to think about when considering race (and other identities) in our evaluations.\nTo read this column, please click here.\n\n\nCALL FOR PAPERS\nPsychological Services to Extend Public Health and Disease Management Approaches in Criminal Justice Settings\nThe editorial staff of Division 18’s APA journal Psychological Services would like to invite you to submit articles for a special section on Psychological Services to Extend Public Health and Disease Management Approaches in Criminal Justice Settings.

It happens in restaurants, on public transportation, and in the street. It also happens behind closed courtroom doors during jury selection. While it is universally recognized that dismissing prospective jurors because they look like racial minorities is prohibited, it is too often deemed acceptable to exclude jurors because they sound like racial minorities. The fact that accent discrimination is commonly racial, ethnic, and national origin discrimination is overlooked. This lecture will critically examine sociolinguistic scholarship to explain the relationship between accent, race, and racism. We will look to jury selection as a case study for this problem, but will also reflect on language discrimination in employment, education, and public accommodations and how such discrimination violates constitutional and civil rights law. We will situate linguistic discrimination within the broader problems of juror language disenfranchisement and broader racial subordination in the U.S.\nThe link for this talk will be available soon.\n\n\nSAVE THE DATE\nPromoting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in the Profession of Correctional Psychology\nA Workshop for Students, Faculty, Clinicians, and Administrators\nSponsored by the AP-LS Corrections Committee and BRIDGE\nPresenters: Dr. Nneka Jones Tapia, Dr. Steven Kniffley, Dr. Valene Whittaker\nFriday, July 30, 2021 12:00pm-1:30pm (ET)\nLike many subfields in psychology, there is a great need to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the correctional psychology workforce.

America May Do It Anyway.\nBrett Jones was fourteen years old when he moved from a dysfunctional and abusive home in Florida to live with his grandparents in Mississippi. He was fifteen when he was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole (LWOP) for stabbing his grandfather to death during an argument that turned physical. In 2012, Mr. Jones turned 23. That year, inMiller v. Alabama, the Supreme Court of the United States abolishedmandatoryLWOP for juveniles convicted of homicide offenses, opening the door for Mr. Jones’ sentence to be reconsidered. Unfortunately, for Mr. Jones, the door closed quickly. Two years later, the state of Mississippi sentenced him, once again, to die in prison for the crime he committed at age 15. Mr. Jones will turn 32 this July. This past April, the Supreme Court upheld his LWOP sentence.\nTo read this column, please click here.\n\n\nSAVE THE DATE!\nAP-LS BRIDGE Committee is inviting you to a Zoom webinar.\nWhen: Jun 28, 2021 05:00 PM Central Time (US and Canada)\nTopic: Color-Blind but not Color-Deaf: Linguistic discrimination in Jury Selection and Beyond\nProfessor Jasmine Gonzales Rose (Boston College School of Law) will be presenting.\nEvery week brings a new story about racialized linguistic discrimination.

These are due January 12, 2021.\nFor APA 2021, all division programming will take place on a virtual platform. Division programming presenters will be required to record and upload their presentations to an online platform prior to the conference. If you would like to include a live follow-up discussion, please use the regular APA portal when uploading your accepted presentation and indicate the time (with time zone) and videoconference (e.g., Zoom) link. Presenters who choose to offer a live component are responsible for the planning and hosting of their own live programming.\nRegular proposals can request continuing education (CE) credit. When you submit a presentation, you will have the option to select “consider for CE.” We will forward these submissions for review by the APA CE Committee. From there, APA will select CEs and manage all CE attendance and certification issues. Please note that regular submission CEs are distinct from Continuing Education workshops (see below).\nDual submissions are not being accepted at this time. A dual submission is one in which the same research is presented at more than one conference. You cannot submit a proposal that has already been submitted to another conference. You are welcome to submit up to two Division 41 proposals to this conference.\nAPA Continuing Education Workshops:\nDue January 6, 2021.\nYou may develop and submit a CE workshop.

The APA co-chair role requires a three-year commitment. The first year (2021) involves shadowing the two senior co-chairs, presently Lauren Kois and Stephane Shepherd. In the second year (2022), the co-chair will take a lead role in selecting content for the program. Finally, in the third year (2023), the APA co-chair will take a leadership role in guiding and supporting the other co-chairs. We encourage self-nominations, particularly in the clinical area this year. The CAC will select one representative to co-chair the conference for the 2021-2023 term.\nTypical deadlines in which co-chairs have increased workloads include: September through October when preparing collaborative programs with other divisions; December through January when assigning reviewers, making selections, and building the program schedule; and, August during the APA Convention.\nPlease submit your nomination including Letter of Intent and CV byJanuary 15, 2021.

The intent of this grant initiative is to advance a more interdisciplinary science that addresses understudied topics in psychology and law, as well as to broaden the discipline and amplify its practical impact. Proposed projects must investigate new or understudied topics in psychology and law, enhance the diversification of psychology and law research through novel theoretical or methodological approaches that are cross-disciplinary in nature, and/or promote the impact of research by considering novel populations or new problems or processes within the legal system. Collaboration with practitioners or policymakers is encouraged. Successful proposals are expected to involve projects with the potential to transform and impact the field by furthering novel lines of research inquiry and/or facilitating new cross-disciplinary collaborations. As part of the AP-LS initiative toward a more inclusive society, grant applications that specifically address disadvantaged groups or understudied topic areas in psychology and law will be given preference. This includes funding scholars from traditionally underprivileged backgrounds. Proposals may be submitted into one of two funding categories:\n \n1.     Small/Seed proposals ($1,000-$5,000 for a 12-month research period)\n2.     Large proposals ($15,000-$50,000 over a 12-18 month research period)\n \nFunding should primarily support research activities and data collection efforts. Support for research assistants and necessary travel may be requested, but should not constitute the majority of the requested funds. No funds can be used to support the salary of the PI or co-PI. Funds for successful proposals will be awarded to the PI’s academic institution (via the institution’s Office of Sponsored Research or Foundation). No institutional indirect cost recovery will be permitted, and proposals submitted for consideration by this program must not be submitted for consideration by other grant programs (including AP-LS programs). Proposals submitted but not funded in previous funding cycles may be resubmitted, but all proposals will be evaluated as new proposals.\n \nResearchers may submit a maximum of one proposal to the large grant mechanism and one proposal to the small grant mechanism. That is, researchers can be an author or co-author on a maximum of one proposal to each of the grant categories. Students may not be PIs on proposals, although they may be Co-PIs.\n \nPre-proposal submissions will open on October 4th. The submission deadline is October 15th, 2023. Selected pre-proposal submissions will be notified in November if they are selected to submit a full proposal. Full proposals will be due in mid-December.\n \nThe application portal and more information on applications can be found at https://ap-ls.org/awards/grants/impactgrant. Please email one or both of the co-chairs of the Research Committee, Megan Kienzle and Eyal Aharoni, with any questions: kienzlem@apsu.edu or eaharoni@gsu.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall for Faculty and Students for Research Mentoring Initiative Pilot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AP-LS Research Committee is seeking applications from both faculty and undergraduate and graduate students to participate in its Research Mentoring Initiative. \n \nThis initiative came out of Dr. Jen Groscup’s Presidential Pre-Conference Leadership Workshop in New Orleans in March of 2020. The goal of the initiative is to pair researchers with one or more students who would not otherwise have research opportunities due to their institution’s location, size, or research resources. To that end, this initiative seeks faculty mentors to spend time virtually with students at different institutions and help guide them through the research process. Ideally, faculty members would either have an existing project that students could participate in or be willing to work with a student to design a new research project. \n \nFor this initiative, we anticipate the length of the mentoring relationship would be for one year with the possibility of extension should it be mutually agreed upon by both faculty and student. The benefits for both the student and mentor are below:\n \nStudents:\n\nEquip students with greater research skills/tools\nProvide students with a hands-on experience through direct work on research projects\nProvide students with an opportunity to complete research in an area of interest\nConnect students with researchers who they would otherwise not have access to (e.g., different schools, different countries, etc.)\nProvide students with general mentorship in the academic process as needed\n\n \nMentors:\n\nProvide researchers with assistance in research\nProvide researchers an opportunity to mentor early student researchers\nProvide researchers with service to Psychology and Law\nContribute to increasing diversity of emerging psychology and law scholars from a variety of institutions\n\n \nIf you are a faculty member or undergraduate/graduate student interested in participating in this program, please fill out this form (https://forms.gle/soFkvvmVw1jMBW5t6) by September 29th, 2023. You may need to copy/paste the link or update your browser if the direct link doesn’t work.\n \nFor questions, please email one or both of the co-chairs of the AP-LS Research Committee, Megan Kienzle and Eyal Aharoni, with any questions: kienzlem@apsu.edu or eaharoni@gsu.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPA President-Election Closes September 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are an APA member, do not forget to vote in the APA President-Elect election.  Candidates are Margaret Bull Kovera, Eric Butter, Debra Kawahara, and Grant Rich.

The APA Advocacy Office has provided an update on its midyear efforts across APA/APA Services’ Advocacy Priorities, including opportunities to engage. Of interest to our members, criminal justice and policing is one of the priority advocacy areas. AP-LS’s liaison with APA for advocacy efforts is Dr. Lauren Kois (Lek8m@virginia.edu).  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPA Amicus Curiae Environmental Scanning Program \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe APA Amicus Curiae Expert Panel will be holding an informational meeting on September 6th, at 3PM EDT (on Zoom) in which we discuss the establishment of a program to conduct environmental scans to identify cases in which APA might weigh in with psychological science.  If you are interested in joining the conversation, please email Theresa McGregor at tmcgregor@apa.org.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Briefs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a look at the latest research briefs for short summaries of the latest articles relevant to psychology-law.

For the past decade, along with a wonderful team of colleagues, I have been working with police departments and sheriff's offices across the country in an effort to change the culture of law enforcement in America. Our goal has been to create a culture of active bystandership among officers, to prevent harm from mistakes, misconduct, and poor officer health and wellness. The program is called Project ABLE (Active Bystandership for Law Enforcement) and it is part of Georgetown Law Center's not-for-profit Center for Innovations in Community Safety (CICS.) \n \nABLE has only existed for three years, and in that short time, has been joined by more than 300 law enforcement agencies across the country, including large departments like the NYPD and the police departments of Denver, Seattle, Boston, Baltimore, and most recently, Los Angeles. There are also a host of smaller ABLE agencies, and many more are waiting in line to join. Currently, more than 100 million Americans are served by ABLE police departments that are trying to create cultures of active bystandership. To meet this need, ABLE is looking for psychologists with criminal justice experience and expertise who want to become part of our team of instructors.\n \nThis is a great way to contribute to building safer and healthier law enforcement cultures, and you would get to work with an incredible group of people that includes psychologists, retired FBI agents, and current and retired leaders from police departments and sheriff's offices across the country.  \n \nIf you're interested, please submit a cover letter outlining your experience, including any prior teaching or facilitation experience, your interest in working with ABLE specifically, and a CV detailing your professional history. Please send it to the ABLE team at ABLE@georgetown.edu. If you have any questions about ABLE, you can also contact Joel at 520-906-0366 or joelthed@aol.com.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendations for the Use of Telepsychology in Psychology-Law Practice and Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe field of psychology has steadily embraced the use of telecommunication technologies to reach clients who may have limited options for local providers, face increased costs and lost wages for travel, or would otherwise go without services altogether (see Guidelines for the Practice of Telepsychology, 2013). Beyond this, remote communication technologies have become a necessity for sustaining clinical practices and safely engaging with clients following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n \nRead the statement by Division 41 of the American Psychological Association &gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin Our Directors' Listserv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are reaching out to AP-LS members to locate training directors of postdoctoral fellowships in forensic psychology. Many of us (fellowship training directors) are already connected on a separate listserv which allows us to ask questions to the group, communicate about the training year, fellowship process issues, etc. If you are a director of a forensic psychology postdoctoral fellowship and are interested in joining our listserv, please email Ashley Murray and let her know your site and position.

Data collection should be complete. Winners will be encouraged to submit their work for presentation at the AP-LS Conference (as first authors). Students may submit their work during their first post-undergraduate year as long as the work was conducted during their undergraduate career.\n \nHow to Apply\n \nSubmit one copy of APA-style paper (Abstract required). The paper should be a maximum of 25 pages of text (12-point font, one-inch margins), including the Abstract and Tables/Figures. The 25-page maximum does not include the Title Page and References. Papers that do not meet these requirements will be disqualified.\n \nEach applicant must have their mentor submit a letter of support to the chair that characterizes the nature and extent of the student’s contribution to the project. This letter should be a maximum of two pages of text (12-point font, one-inch margins). Applications that do not meet these requirements for letters of support will be disqualified.\n \nDeadline for receipt of all materials is June 30. The paper and mentor letter should be emailed to Dr. Emily Pica at undergrad_paper@ap-ls.org.\n \nSubmissions from students whose mentors are serving on this committee are welcome, but those mentors will not review the papers.\n \nPlease see our website for additional details&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall for Book Proposals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe American Psychology-Law Society invites proposals for new titles in its book series, which is now published by APA Books.

Although there was a decline in the number of votes cast by APA members for Division 41 in the 2024 apportionment process, we did maintain our two Council of Representative seats. To maintain these two Division 41 seats on Council, it will be important for those APLS members who are also APA members to cast more of their votes for Division 41 in the next apportionment vote.\n \nOutcome of Voting on Amendments to APA Bylaws\nAll three of the most recently proposed amendments to the APA bylaws were approved by the membership (proportion of voting members approving in parentheses below).\n \n\nAmendment #1 – Update Mission of Membership Board to be in Alignment with Current Practices  (84.05%)\nAmendment #2 – Association Members Gain Voting Privileges After One Year Instead of Five Years (73.33%)\nAmendment #3 – Add a Graduate Student member on the Board for the Advancement of Psychology in the Public Interest, Board of Convention Affairs, Board of Educational Affairs, Board of Professional Affairs, Board of Scientific Affairs, Membership Board and Policy and Planning Board (82.28%)\n\n \nLeadership Opportunities & Fellowships\nAPA seeks nominations (including self-nominations) for its many boards and committees. We strongly encourage you to review the openings and nomination instructions. This is a great way to gain leadership experience and to get the voice of AP-LS heard within APA governance. You need to be an APA member to serve on an APA board or committee. Nominations are due January 31. Election slates are then developed and the APA Board of Directors approves the slates by mid-April. APA Council members then vote in Fall 2023. Additional questions can be directed to the APA Election Office at elections@apa.org. \n \nAPA also seeks nominees for the APA Congressional Fellowship program and APA Executive Branch Science Fellowship. Applications are due January 30. \n \nStandards of Accreditation for Master's Degree Programs\nAPA seeks public comments on Implementing Regulations related to the Standards of Accreditation for Health Service Psychology, Master’s Degree Programs, which outline education and training requirements for the accreditation of health service psychology programs at the master’s level. Information about the proposed standards and public comment is available on their website. Comments are due by February 2, 2023. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAP-LS 2023 Submission Decisions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecisions regarding AP-LS 2023 conference submissions have been published.  Please log in to your Ex Ordo account or contact the first/presenting author for more information.  Early bird registration discount ends on January 31.

Practitioners are in a unique position to offer education, assessment, intervention and advocacy on issues of REC disparities, racism, and discrimination in the field of psychology and the law. However, a limited body of research, lack of practice guidelines on REC integration in forensic practice, and low representation of Black, Indigenous, People Of Color (BIPOC) professionals, limit such efforts. Mentorship of emerging practitioners in psychology and the law on such issues can bridge the gap of knowledge, application, and BIPOC representation in the field.  \n \nThe AP-LS Practice Committee wants to recognize the substantive contributions of practitioner mentors who educate and support emerging clinicians in psychology and the law with a lens toward the elimination of REC disparities and social justice. For these purposes, we use Goldstein’s (2007) definition of the practice of psychology and the law: “The application of psychological research, theory, practice, and traditional and specialized methodology (e.g.  interviewing, psychological testing, forensic assessment, and forensically relevant instruments) to provide information relevant to a legal question.”  \n \nThe award for Outstanding Practitioner Mentoring to Eliminate Racial, Ethnic and Cultural (REC) Disparities in the Field of Psychology and the Law, will be conferred on a yearly basis. The Recipient will receive a $500.00 cash award, a plaque to be presented at the annual AP-LS conference and will be featured in an AP-LS newsletter article, written by the practice committee, highlighting the recipient’s achievements and recommendations to other practitioners. Highlighting the recipient's mentorship practices and experiences can serve as a model for other professionals in the field of psychology and the law.  \n\nNomination packages are due January 15, 2023 and should be emailed to the chair of the award subcommittee, Dr. Lara Guzmán-Hosta at lguzman.hosta@gmail.com.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBRIDGE Committee Award Programs\nCall for Applications 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AP-LS Broadening Representation Inclusion, Diversity, and Global Equity or BRIDGE Committee is seeking applicants for two award programs. As part of the BRIDGE Committee initiative to increase diversity within AP-LS, and the profession as a whole, these award programs support research for undergraduate and graduate students. Please take a few minutes to review the program descriptions below and consider if you or any students you know might be eligible, and encourage them to apply. Also, please feel free to forward this information to any colleagues who might be interested in these award programs. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15, 2022 through January 15, 2023. Recipients will be announced in February 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit Award Applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess Path to Psychology and Law Experience Program\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Access Path to Psychology and Law Experience (AP) Program is to increase diversity within psychology and law by increasing the pipeline of competitive graduate school applicants from groups that currently are underrepresented in the field, including racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and disabled students. AP is designed to encourage faculty members to recruit students from underrepresented groups into their research labs. It provides financial support for the students to obtain meaningful research experience and attend the AP-LS conference as well as other opportunities for mentoring and development. It is the intention of the BRIDGE Committee that many of the students in the AP program will apply for graduate training related to psychology and law and ultimately become professionals in the field. The AP program primarily targets undergraduate students, but students from terminal master’s degree programs will also be considered. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15, 2022 through January 15, 2023. Recipients will be announced in February 2023.\n\nFor more information about the AP Program, please contact the program Chair, Dr. Jason Lawrence at jason.lawrence@dmh.mo.gov.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit Award Applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAP-LS Diversity in Psychology and Law Research Awards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Diversity in Psychology and Law Research Awards is to promote diversity within the American Psychology-Law Society by supporting student research on psycholegal issues related to diversity as well as research by students from underrepresented groups. Projects are eligible for consideration for this award if (1) they investigate topics related to psychology, law, diversity, and/or multiculturalism (e.g., research pertaining to psycholegal issues on race, gender, culture, sexual orientation, etc.) or (2) if the principal investigator is a member of an underrepresented group, including racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and students with disabilities. Consistent with the mission of the BRIDGE Committee, these awards are intended to facilitate the research of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in AP-LS, as well as research about issues of potential interest and importance to such groups. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15, 2022 through January 15, 2023. Recipients will be announced in February 2023.\n\nFor more information about the Diversity Program, please contact the program Chair, Dr. Evelyn Maeder at evelyn.maeder@carlton.ca.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit Award Applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversity Travel Awards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of an initiative to increase diversity within AP-LS, the Minority Affairs Committee will provide travel awards to students from underrepresented groups (i.e., racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and students with disabilities) who are presenting research at the American Psychology-Law Society Conference. Seven competitive travel awards in the amount of $500 will be given. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15, 2022 through January 15, 2023. Recipients will be announced in February 2023.\n\nFor more information about the Diversity Travel Award program, please contact the program Chair, Dr. Amanda NeMoyer at ann38@drexel.edu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit Award Applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall for Book Proposals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe American Psychology-Law Society invites proposals for new authored and edited volumes on psychology-law topics for its book series (now published by APA Books).

This summer, as you are preparing a new course or just want to refresh one, please check out the syllabi collection for ideas! And, if you have taught a course, please consider sharing yours on the AP-LS website! To submit your syllabus, use the online form that is also available on the website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall for Papers: Special Issue on Bias in the Justice and Legal Systems \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBias is a pervasive aspect of human thought and behavior that influences how we perceive, interpret, and respond to the world around us. Individual biases, which may be implicit or explicit, also contribute to structural biases in the systems we create. Bias is a problem in the justice and legal systems because they are built upon assumptions of fairness and equality. \n \nSocial scientists who study the justice and legal systems can contribute greatly to our \nunderstanding of bias and its underlying mechanisms, consequences, and potential \ninterventions. It is critical for social scientists to address these issues and to disseminate our knowledge in an accessible manner. \n \nTo this end, Law and Human Behavior seeks submissions for an upcoming special issue on Bias in the Justice and Legal Systems edited by Lucy Guarnera, Jennifer Perillo, and Kyle Scherr. We define bias as the influence of irrelevant factors (or the misapplication of relevant factors) to create systematic deviations in how people solve problems, make decisions, or form judgments.  We are soliciting submissions that examine the influence of bias in the justice and legal systems including, but not limited, to: \n  \n\nAttorneys (charges, disclosure, plea bargains, jury selection) \nCivil (child custody, personal injury) \nEducation (school discipline, Title IX) \nForensic experts (selection of cases, assessment of evidence, formation of opinions, task relevance) \nImmigration (legal status, deportation) \nIncarceration and other legal sanctions (risk assessment, mental health, infractions) \nJudges (excluding/limiting expert testimony, rulings, sentencing) \nJuries (credibility assessments, deliberation, verdicts) \nLaw enforcement (stops, arrest, use of force, interrogations) \nMilitary (courts martial, intelligence interviewing, information gathering) \nPretrial (detention, bail, access to quality legal representation) \nReentry & community corrections (probation, employment, housing, education) \nWrongful conviction, exoneration, & confession \n\n \nBecause these systems consist of multiple decision-points, with the potential for one judgment to influence others, we will give particular preference to papers that examine the accumulation of bias at multiple decision-points within and across systems. Cumulative disadvantage and similar frameworks may be relevant here. We also encourage submissions investigating bias related to individual identities (e.g., race, ethnicity, sexual or gender identities, immigration status), as well as structural biases inherent in conflict resolution and adversarial processes (e.g., accessibility, availability of resources). \n \nWe welcome submissions that use quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods to address theoretical, methodological, and practice issues involving bias. To maximize the potential impact of this Special Issue, we ask authors to write in a manner that is accessible to readers outside their discipline, including lay readers. In addition, every submission must contain a section that explicitly addresses the practical and policy implications of the work. \n \nAuthors interested in contributing a manuscript for the Special Issue should submit a \nnonbinding letter of intent by July 15, 2023. This letter should include (1) tentative title, (2) brief description of the manuscript in 500 words or less, and (3) all authors and affiliations. Please email letters of intent to LHB.bias@gmail.com. \n \nAuthors who submit letters of intent will be notified if they are invited to submit a full manuscript for consideration. The deadline to submit a manuscript is November 1, 2023.  Authors should refer to the Submission Guidelines on the Law and Human Behavior website (https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/lhb?tab=1) and prepare their manuscripts in accordance with the Seventh Edition of the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association. Authors should submit electronically using the Editorial Manager web portal (https://www.editorialmanager.com/lhb/default.aspx) and specify in their cover letters that they would like their submissions to be considered for the Special Issue on Bias in the Justice and Legal Systems. \n  \nQuestions about the Special Issue or the potential appropriateness of particular submissions can be sent to LHB.bias@gmail.com or directed to the editors, Lucy Guarnera (lag8e@virginia.edu), Jen Perillo (JTPerillo@salud.unm.edu), or Kyle Scherr \n(scher1kc@cmich.edu). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin Division 41 at APA 2023!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, Division 41 will feature 11 sessions and 61 posters.\n\nJoin us for an incredible conference with an impressive lineup of speakers and sessions that will enlighten and empower you.

Did you think of My Cousin Vinny or Law & Order: SVU? Chances are you imagined a dramatic moment where the lawyer asks the one question that blows the case wide open. But what if jurors could ask questions as well? \n \nDespite being an experienced trial attorney in both federal and state court with a master’s degree in legal and forensic psychology, it was not until last summer during a two-week trial in Dallas County that I experienced this practice first-hand. This trial was an opportunity for me to expand my jury science specialty, specifically in regard to the practice of jurors asking questions—through the judge—during trial. While juror questioning varies greatly depending on the courtroom due to judicial discretion, but, generally, judges who allow the practice ask jury members to write any outstanding questions they have for a witness at the end of the attorney-led examination and any questions not objected to by attorneys are then asked of the witness by the judge. This practice balances juror anonymity and neutrality while also leading to an overall increased level of engagement and dedication of the jury.   \n \nThis article discusses the historical context of juror questioning, as well as the benefits, concerns, and the practical implications for civil cases. At bottom, the practice of jurors asking questions does not appear to be subsiding. In fact, it continues to grow—judges, lawyers, witnesses, and prospective jurors should all be aware of what this looks like for the future.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the Full Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall for Co-Chairs for 2024 AP-LS Conference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AP-LS Conference Advisory Committee (CAC) is seeking two interested professionals to co-chair the March 2024 Annual Conference in Los Angeles.

Deadline for submissions is March 15, 2023.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPsychology, Public Policy, and Law -\nFellowship Announcement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are very pleased to let you know that the journal has secured funds from APA’s P&C Board to fund two editorial fellowships for early-career psychologists (ECPs) from historically excluded groups. This is a momentous and exciting step forward for our program’s efforts to address systemic racism, in line with several recent APA resolutions. Both fellowships will begin on 1 January 2023 and will involve an honoraria stipend of $1,000 USD.  \n  \nThese fellowships are designed specifically to elevate opportunities for ECPs from historically excluded groups (particularly Black, Indigenous, and other people of color, as well as members from other communities which have been historically excluded from leadership opportunities in research and publishing). \n \nThe fellowships are open to qualified candidates who have completed their education/training and are no more than 10 years postdoctoral, including current members of the journal’s editorial board. Candidates would typically hold a position at the rank of assistant professor (or equivalent, such as a research scientist), although individuals in non-academic positions and suitable qualifications are also eligible. The fellowships will last one year, and fellows will receive a stipend of $1,000 for the year.\n \nQualified candidates should have experience conducting peer reviews, and expertise in topics of cultural and ethnic diversity is desirable. We also look for evidence of a broad perspective, good judgment, exceptional communication skills, and strong management skills, as well as a commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion.\n \nThe fellows will work closely with the journal’s Editor, Michael E. Lamb, or one of the associate editors, Nancy Steblay and Tess Neal, to develop their editorial skills. Each fellow will manage approximately 6 to 12 manuscripts over the course of the year. This process will include screening manuscripts for appropriateness, identifying reviewers, making an editorial decision based on reviews, and shepherding the manuscript through to publication if accepted, all with mentorship from the editor or associate editor. The successful candidate will also be expected to participate in monthly meetings with their mentor to ensure goals are met. Most of these meetings will be video teleconferences, although in-person meetings at scientific conferences are also possible. Upon successful completion of the fellowship, Editorial fellows will become members of the journal’s editorial board if they are not already.\n \nPlease encourage interested and qualified candidates to send an application to mel37@cam.ac.uk by 31 October 2022. They should include a cover letter introducing themselves, their expertise, and an explanation of why they would be appropriate candidates, as well as a copy of their CV. Appointments will be made in the fall and the positions will begin at the start of 2023. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall for Faculty and Students for Research Mentoring Initiative Pilot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AP-LS Research Committee is seeking applications from both faculty and undergraduate and graduate students to pilot its new Research Mentoring Initiative. This initiative came out of Dr. Jen Groscup’s Presidential Pre-Conference Leadership Workshop in New Orleans in March of 2020. The goal of the initiative is to pair researchers with one or more students who would not otherwise have research opportunities due to their institution’s location, size, or teaching emphasis. To that end, this initiative seeks faculty mentors to virtually spend time with students at different institutions and help guide them through the research process. Ideally, faculty members would either have an existing project that students could participate in or be willing to work with a student to design a new research project.  \n \nFor this pilot, we are the anticipated length of the mentoring relationship would be for one year with the possibility of extension should it be mutually agreed upon by both faculty and student. The benefits for both the student and mentor are below: \n \nStudents: \n\nEquip students with greater research skills/tools \nProvide students with a hands-on experience through direct work on research projects \nProvide students with an opportunity to complete research in an area of interest \nConnect students with researchers who they would otherwise not have access to (e.g., different schools, different countries) \nProvide students with general mentorship in the academic process as needed \n\nMentors: \n\nProvide researchers an opportunity to mentor early student researchers \nProvide researchers with service to Psychology and Law \nContribute to increasing diversity of emerging psychology and law scholars from a variety of institutions \n\nIf you are a faculty member or undergraduate/graduate student interested in participating in this program, please fill out this form by 29 September 2022. \n \nFor questions, please email the chair of the AP-LS Research Committee, Colleen Berryessa, at colleen.berryessa@rutgers.edu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall for Volunteers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Early Career Professionals Committee and the Teaching, Training, and Careers Committee are calling for volunteers for an upcoming speaker series.\n\nParticipate in a less than 10 minute recorded interview\nDiscuss your work and how you incorporate anti-racism\n$100 honorarium \n\nEmail Your Submission to ecp@ap-ls.org.  The deadline to submit is 15 August 2022.

It is important to recognize early career professionals as there are often a myriad of novel challenges and concerns that they are required to navigate. Many of these concerns are often introduced after their graduate studies are completed. These challenges may include obtaining licensure, establishing private practices, and seeking continued education credits. The ECP would like to further the mission of AP-LS to increase research, education, and training around diversity, equity, and inclusion. \n \nAre you a professional who identifies as early career (per APA less than ten years since graduating) and currently practicing primarily as a practitioner?

Using a variety of research methods and analytic techniques, they aim to understand and improve these aspects of our social world.  \n \nPsychologists provide valuable insights into human cognition, emotion, and behavior in the legal (criminal and civil) justice systems. CRN-54 ‘Law, Society & Psychological Science’ represents a community of psychologists. You will also find psychologists in other CRNs (e.g., CRN-4 ‘Lay Participation in Legal Systems’). \n \nThe LSA provides a unique opportunity for psychologists to: \n\nUnderstand the ‘problem-space’ by learning about justice systems from all around the world  \nIncrease the ability to affect change by networking with practitioners (e.g., lawyers, judges, prosecutors, mediators) and legal policymakers \nExpand research networks to scholars from relevant disciplines (e.g., Law, Sociology, Criminology, and Politics)\nCollaborate on large-scale projects (e.g., to improve the jury system globally, to understand use of technology in the courtroom)\n\nThe LSA meetings are held in fantastic places across the world and come with free opportunities to tour local justice system facilities (e.g., prisons, courts). \n \nIf you’d like to know more about the LSA and how you can participate in CRN-54, please contact ygranot@smith.edu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLHB Nomination for Editor-in-Chief\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nominations and Awards Committee of the American Psychology-Law Society (AP-LS), Division 41 of the American Psychological Association, invites nominations (including self-nominations) for the next Editor-in-Chief of Law and Human Behavior (LHB), the official journal of the AP-LS.\n \nNominees should submit a cover letter, C.V., and vision statement for the journal (including attention to AP-LS’s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNomination Form\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EC is willing to entertain a proposal for Co-Editors, but the nominees should explain the team’s approach and distribution of responsibilities between Co-Editors in the cover letter. Nomination materials will be accepted until January 15, 2023. Finalists will be invited to the AP-LS Executive Committee meeting at the Annual Conference in March 2023.\n \nThe voting members of the EC will make the final decision. Questions about nominations, the process, or the position should be directed to the Chair of the Nominations and Awards Committee, Dr. Lora Levett at llevett@ufl.edu. \n\nBeginning in January 2024, the appointed candidate will serve as Incoming Editor for one year and will receive all new submissions. The Incoming Editor will appoint Incoming Associate Editors and will be mentored by the Editor. In January 2025, the Incoming Editor will transition to a six-year term as Editor-in-Chief and will spend the last year mentoring the next Incoming Editor while also continuing to oversee the review process for any manuscripts submitted during the previous six years.\n \nThe Editor’s responsibilities will include appointing the Associate Editors and Editorial Board, selecting Ad-Hoc Reviewers, soliciting manuscripts, managing the peer-review, and publication process, serving as a liaison with the publisher, reporting to the AP-LS Executive Committee and serving as an ex-officio, non-voting member of the AP-LS Executive Committee, representing the journal to all constituencies, and coordinating all other journal operations.\n \nThe Editor will take the lead role in any publication contract negotiations that occur during their term (however, the final contract must be approved by voting members of the AP-LS Executive Committee). The Editor will manage the journal’s Editorial Budget and in doing so, will consider the needs of the Associate Editors and Incoming Editor. \n \nLaw and Human Behavior publishes 6 issues a year and is the official journal of APA Division 41 (American Psychology-Law Society). LHB is a multidisciplinary forum for empirical manuscripts examining the interface between human behavior and the law, the criminal justice and legal system, and the legal process.\n \nThe journal publishes original, theory-driven, quantitative, and qualitative research from a variety of fields, including law, psychology, psychiatry, criminal justice, political science, sociology, education, and communication. Meta-analytic reviews of previous research results also are encouraged. Occasionally, the journal publishes methodological or theoretical papers. Although pure legal analysis falls outside the scope of the journal, we strongly encourage authors to situate their research in the law and discuss implications for criminal justice and/or legal policies and practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPA Science Directorate Updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe APA Science Directorate created new \"Science Liaison\" relationships with the various divisional organizations within APA. At the first meeting (10/18/22), there were a couple of updates worth sharing with the AP-LS membership. First, the clear theme of the meeting was that \"APA is changing.\" There are serious efforts underway at APA to better support strong science. One way be up to speed with what's going on is to subscribe to the biweekly \"Science Spotlight\" newsletter put out by the Science Directorate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second update is that APA has constituted a new Amicus Brief Expert Panel with some Div 41 members on the panel. They will be seeking input from across Div 41 (and also other divisions) in looking out for key issues and key cases, and they also plan to be present at the AP-LS conference in March. Stay tuned for more information through this newsletter, at the conference, and from the Panel itself.\n \n- Tess Neal, Div 41 liaison to the APA Science Directorate  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching in Psychology and Law: Mapping the Criminal Legal System: A Day-One Activity for an Undergraduate Psych-Law Course\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Allison Redlich, recipient of the 2022 AP-LS Teaching and Mentoring award from the Teaching, Training, and Careers Committee shares an activity developed for the first or second day of an undergraduate psych-law course.\n \nAn activity to be used before initial readings have been assigned, the purpose is to introduce the substance and types of research conducted by psycho-legal scholars, and how and where such research fits into the criminal legal system.\n \nRead this column.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCareer Corner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Career Corner is intended to highlight the individuals who work at the intersection of law and psychology, where they come from, how they got there, and how their experiences influence their research, teaching, and/or practice.\n \nThis edition of Career Corner profiles Dr. Barry Rosenfeld, PhD, a professor of psychology at Fordham University. Dr. Rosenfeld is currently serving as the 2022-2023 President of the American Psychology-Law Society (APA Division 41). Dr. Rosenfeld has research interests in several domains, including violence risk triage, cross-cultural applications of forensic assessment techniques, assessment and interventions strategies to reduce psychological distress, and evaluations of distress among immigrants and refugees.\n \nRead this column.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTTC Committee’s Teaching and Mentoring Awards:\nCall for Nominations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach year the AP-LS Teaching, Training, and Careers (TTC) Committee confers two awards for outstanding teaching and mentoring. These awards recognize teaching excellence in the field of psychology and law in a variety of contexts, specifically the Outstanding Teaching and Mentoring Award and the Early Career Teaching and Mentoring Award. \n \nFor more information about the awards, eligibility, and how to nominate yourself or others, visit the Teaching and Mentoring Awards webpage.\n \nThis year the TTC Committee is specifically soliciting nominations for individuals from doctoral-granting or post-doctoral granting programs/departments (i.e., Category 2 Awards). Winners will be announced at the 2023 AP-LS Conference that will be held at the Marriott, Downtown, Philadelphia, PA, from March 16-18, 2023. Award recipients receive $500, a plaque at the AP-LS conference, and an opportunity to serve as a guest columnist for the AP-LS Newsletter.\n \nNominations are due by December 15, 2022. Nominations can be emailed to ttc@apls.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep AP-LS'S Voice Heard at APA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers of the American Psychological Association (APA) should receive their 2022 APA Ballot via e-mail on November 1. It is important that you promptly vote to keep AP-LS's voice heard at APA. \n \nThe ballot will include votes on changes to the APA bylaws and an apportionment ballot which determines how many voting members AP-LS gets on APA's governing body, the Council of Representatives (Council). In the past year, your AP-LS representatives (Jason Cantone and Margaret Bull Kovera) have co-written legislation on the interrogation of criminal suspects, removal of felony status questions on psychological association applications, the creation of a Council ombuds, and removal of mental health treatment questions from bar exam character and fitness examinations, as well as legislation to improve the APA policymaking process. \n \nApportionment votes determine how many representatives AP-LS can send to APA Council. With more Council Representatives, we can better call attention to issues dear to our members and have a greater influence on APA policy. In the past few years, AP-LS has been very close to gaining a third representative! To get that third representative, we need each APA member to give all 10 of their apportionment votes to Division 41/AP-LS. Please make sure to vote! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2023 AP-LS Conference Reviewers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you agreed to review submissions for the 2023 AP-LS annual conference in Philadelphia, your assigned submissions are now available to review on Ex Ordo.

As part of the BRIDGE Committee initiative to increase diversity within AP-LS, and the profession as a whole, these award programs support research for undergraduate and graduate students. Please take a few minutes to review the program descriptions below and consider if you or any students you know might be eligible, and encourage them to apply. Also, please feel free to forward this information to any colleagues who might be interested in these award programs. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15, 2022 through January 15, 2023. Recipients will be announced in February 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit Award Applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess Path to Psychology and Law Experience Program\n\nThe purpose of the Access Path to Psychology and Law Experience (AP) Program is to increase diversity within psychology and law by increasing the pipeline of competitive graduate school applicants from groups that currently are underrepresented in the field, including racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and disabled students. AP is designed to encourage faculty members to recruit students from underrepresented groups into their research labs. It provides financial support for the students to obtain meaningful research experience and attend the AP-LS conference as well as other opportunities for mentoring and development. It is the intention of the BRIDGE Committee that many of the students in the AP program will apply for graduate training related to psychology and law and ultimately become professionals in the field. The AP program primarily targets undergraduate students, but students from terminal master’s degree programs will also be considered. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15th, 2022 through January 15, 2023. Recipients will be announced in February 2023.\n\nFor more information about the AP Program, please contact the program Chair, Dr. Jason Lawrence at jason.lawrence@dmh.mo.gov.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit Award Applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAP-LS Diversity in Psychology and Law Research Awards\n\nThe purpose of the Diversity in Psychology and Law Research Awards is to promote diversity within the American Psychology-Law Society by supporting student research on psycholegal issues related to diversity as well as research by students from underrepresented groups. Projects are eligible for consideration for this award if (1) they investigate topics related to psychology, law, diversity, and/or multiculturalism (e.g., research pertaining to psycholegal issues on race, gender, culture, sexual orientation, etc.) or (2) if the principal investigator is a member of an underrepresented group, including racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and students with disabilities. Consistent with the mission of the BRIDGE Committee, these awards are intended to facilitate the research of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in AP-LS, as well as research about issues of potential interest and importance to such groups. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15th, 2022 through January15, 2023. Recipients will be announced in February 2023.\n\nFor more information about the Diversity Program, please contact the program Chair, Dr. Evelyn Maeder at evelyn.maeder@carlton.ca.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit Award Applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversity Travel Awards\n\nAs part of an initiative to increase diversity within AP-LS, the Minority Affairs Committee will provide travel awards to students from underrepresented groups (i.e., racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and students with disabilities) who are presenting research at the American Psychology-Law Society Conference. Seven competitive travel awards in the amount of $500 will be given. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15, 2022 through January 15, 2023.

This special issue (whose articles are all open access) addressed a major gap in the literature by providing comprehensive, credible reviews of the psychometric evidence for and legal status of some of the most commonly-used psychological and personality assessment measures used in forensic evaluations. This webinar series expands on these articles and is an opportunity to engage with some of the authors of many of the articles.\n\nIn addition to the member rate for the series, this partnership affords all AP-LS members the opportunity to earn ONE FREE CE CREDIT for viewing the Introduction Overview of this webinar series.

It is important to recognize early career professionals as there are often a myriad of novel challenges and concerns that they are required to navigate. Many of these concerns are often introduced after their graduate studies are completed. These challenges may include obtaining licensure, establishing private practices, and seeking continued education credits. The ECP would like to further the mission of AP-LS to increase research, education, and training around diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n \nAre you a professional who identifies as early career (less than 10 years since graduating) and currently practicing primarily as a practitioner? You may qualify for the ECP Practitioner Grant.\n \nTo apply, send a cover letter that includes:  \n\nFirst and last name\nYear last degree obtained\nEmail address\nTelephone number\nMailing address\nA letter of intent (1,500 word maximum) that describes\n- Your current professional role(s) and connection to the field of psychology and law\n- How you intend to use the grant\n- How receiving the grant will enhance your practice and career growth\n- How receiving the grant will further the practice of psychology and law\n- How receiving the grant will contribute to broader impacts to society and the broader mission of AP-LS to increase efforts in diversity, equity, and inclusion.\nUpdated CV\n\nEmail applications to ecp@ap-ls.org.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Your Submission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deadline to submit is August 15, 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall for Volunteers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Early Career Professionals Committee and the Teaching, Training, and Careers Committee are calling for volunteers for an upcoming speaker series.\n\nParticipate in a &lt;10 minute recorded interview\nDiscuss your work and how you incorporate anti-racism\n$100 honorarium\n\nFor more information, please contact ecp@ap-ls.org.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall for Book Proposals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe American Psychology-Law Society invites proposals for new authored and edited volumes on psychology-law topics for its book series (now published by APA Books).

Levett, PhD\nAP-LS President\nIt is an exciting time for AP-LS! I always enjoy anticipating the annual conference, but this year is particularly poignant given our world circumstances over the past 2 years. In case you missed it, the conference grid is now available! I look forward to connecting with many of you in Denver and learning about the latest and greatest research in psychology and law.\nThis column marks part two of three in the series of columns introducing my presidential initiative centered on increasing the impact of our science. The TL; DR: I am forming three presidential task force committees. The first will create a plan for helping AP-LS better provide training and support our members in communicating our science to relevant legal stakeholders. The second is devoted to improving how we recognize our members for their contributions to the field and to the Society. The third is designed to explore creating an oral history project for our society, capturing our members’ stories and contributions related to the intersection of psychology and law. Today, I am introducing the second task force committee devoted to recognizing our members for their contributions to the field and to AP-LS.\nTo read more about the first task force committee, please see part one of this series in the January 2022 newsletter. To nominate yourself or someone else to serve on one of the task forces, please click here.To learn more about the second task force read on, and then check back in March for a preview of the third task force committee.\nPresidential Task Force Committee Two: Recognizing Member Contributions\nPart of increasing the impact of our work in the public sector involves recognizing the effort and lengths that our members go to ensure impact. However, traditional academic culture does not typically recognize this form of service in the traditional pillars of research, teaching, and service. With some exceptions, academic culture generally relies on the individual scholars to do the work of ensuring the impact of their science independent of their positions as academics.\nIn examining how we recognize our members’ contributions, our award structure has generally followed academic culture with some exceptions. We have an Outstanding Teaching and Mentoring Award, research grants and awards to recognize outstanding research contributions, and some awards to promote our organization’s goals of making significant strides in values of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Access. We also have the Distinguished Contributions to Psychology and Law Award, which could apply to folks who have made distinguished empirical, theoretical and/or applied contributions at the highest level.\nHowever, we do not have awards that recognize members for their service to the community through the application of psychological science. We do not recognize particularly influential papers in a particular year. We could improve the way we recognize members for significant contributions to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, or Access. Part of changing the culture is recognizing ourselves that our members contribute beyond what is traditionally expected in academia – we can start to change that culture through recognizing it as a Society.\nThe purpose of this task force is to strategically re-examine our award structure. How are our members contributing to the world in ways that are consistent with our mission and values? How are they contributing to the Society? Are we sufficiently recognizing our members for all these contributions? How can we do better? The product of this task force will be recommendations to the Executive Committee on how to revise our award structure based on the goal of better recognizing members for their good work. Click here to nominate yourself or someone else to serve on this task force.\nIn March, I’ll introduce the third task force designed to capture some of those contributions in an oral history project.Thank you for the opportunity to serve you all in this role. By working together, we can better recognize our members for their diverse and vast contributions to psychology and law.\n\n\nAP-LS Practice Committee & The Society for Personality Assessment\nTheAP-LS PracticeCommitteestrives to meet thedistinct needs of forensic clinicians.To that end, the Practice Committee is excited to announce our 2nd year of partnershipwith The Society for Personality Assessment(SPA), the largest organization dedicated to advance the evidence-based practice and impact of personality assessment through research, education, training, and advocacy.\nThis partnership affords all AP-LS members theSPA Member ratefor all of their workshops, as well as theSPA Convention, which is scheduled to be in personMarch 9-13, in Chicago, IL at the Westin Michigan Avenue hotel.

Room reservations must be made by February 14, 2022, more information on the hotel can be found here.\nThis year Featured Lecturers include our AP-LS Practice Committee Chair, Dr. Antoinette Kavanaugh. In addition to Dr. Kavanaugh’s lecture, The Elephant in the Room: Whiteness in Psychology and Law, SPA will have the following lectures:\n\nBruno Klopfer Award Lecture | Dr. Aaron Pincus\nWho are the Game Changers? Why We Need to Study Leadership in Adolescence | Dr. Jennifer Tackett\nSchool Threat Assessment: An Evidence-based Violence Prevention Strategy | Dr. Dewey Cornell\n\nAll featured lecture abstracts can be found here.\nThe Practice Committee members, Antoinette Kavanaugh, Danielle Rynczak, Lara Guzmán-Hosta, Ariel Breaux, Yenys Castillo, and Rebecca Rivas have joined with Dr. Tess Neal, who is a member of both organizations to bring you the session titled Can We Talk? Facilitating a Dialogue between Clinicians and Researchers on Friday, March 11, 2022, at 1:30pm.\nThere are also pre- and post-convention workshops where AP-LS members will receive the SPA Member rate. All workshops can be found here, but we have identified the following workshops highly relevant to AP-LS members:\n\nClinical and Forensic Assessment of Psychological Trauma | Workshop A (7 CE Credits)\nMulti-Method and Contextual, Diversity-Sensitive Methods in Assessment | Workshop B (7 CE Credits)\nAn Integrative Approach to Personality Assessment using the PAI and SPECTRA | Workshop E (3.5 CE Credits)\nIntegrating Race, Ethnicity, and Culture (REC) into Forensic Mental Health Assessments | Workshop G (3.5 CE Credits)\nEvidence-Based Applications of the MMPI-3 in Forensic Psychological Evaluations | Workshop J (7 CE Credits)\nPractical, Not Pathological: Understanding Cultural Mistrust in Testing | Workshop M (3.5 CE Credits)\n\nSPAis approved by the American Psychological Association to sponsor continuing education for psychologists. While SPAmaintains responsibility for this program and its content,the PracticeCommittee is pleased topartner with SPA for the aboveworkshops. Many of the live presentations sessions also have the opportunity for CEs through APA. Specific sessions and hours are still being finalized.\nRegistrationis now open. When you create your profile, please indicate your AP-LS membership category to receive the member rate upon registration.\nIf you have any questions, please reach out toinfo@spaonline.org.\nIf you are interested in discussing other ways the Practice Committee can meet the needs of forensic clinicians within AP-LS, please contact danielle.rynczak@umassmed.edu.\n\n\nAPA Convention Update\nUpdates regarding the Annual Convention of the American Psychological Association to be held in person on the 4th - 7th August in Minneapolis.\nIn response to our call for Div. 41 proposals, we received 67 APA submissions, including posters, discussions, skill-building sessions, data-blitzes, and symposia.

The agenda is expected to include the revisedResolution of Interrogation on Criminal Suspects,which was revised by a group of AP-LS experts and endorsed by the AP-LS Executive Committee. Also, your Council Reps (Jason Cantone and Margaret Bull Kovera) are working alongside other Council Reps including Michael Lamb (Division 7 Rep and AP-LS Secretary) on legislation that would \"ban the box\" and remove the felony status question from APA membership applications. A report of the meeting will be included in a later newsletter.\nAdditionally, the 2022 APA Board and Committee Call for Nominations deadline was extended toFebruary 7. We strongly encourage AP-LS/APA members to get involved in APA governance. Please visithttps://nomination.apa.org/to make a self-nomination or to nominate someone else.\nCareer Corner\nTheCareerCorneris intended to highlight the individuals who work at the intersection of law and psychology, where they come from, how they got there and how their experiences influence their research, teaching, and/or practice. This edition ofCareer features CornerEmily J. Salisbury, Ph.D., the director of the Utah Criminal Justice Center.\nTo read this column, please click here.\nLegal Update: The Impact of Reproductive Rights Laws on Health Policies\nThe 14th Amendment of the United States (U.S.) Constitution includes liberty and privacy doctrines upon which laws concerning marriage and childbearing depend. Under these doctrines, persons in the U.S. are guaranteed freedom from unwarranted government interference with respect to privacy in choosing their marital partners, if or when to procreate, if and what contraception to use, how to regulate what drugs are prescribed, how to assure bodily integrity, and other related medical decisions. Laws have been passed and judicial decisions made to variously facilitate or restrict the granting of these controversial liberties, with the questions of privacy and equality always looming large.\nCurrently, there is disparity in laws regulating women’s right to obtain an abortion and men’s right to destroy frozen fertilized embryos to exercise when and if they wish to procreate, despite the scientific data assuring safety and public opinion favoring unrestricted choice in both areas. Further, such laws discriminate against economically disadvantaged individuals and persons of color, who are less able to afford access to legal and safe healthcare. This article will discuss the current legal landscape around reproductive rights laws, health policies, and considerations for psychologists.\nTo read this column, please click here.\n\n\nAP-LS Conference Information\nAP-LS 2022 is just around the corner, and we’re excited for a program packed with great presentations. On March 16th, we’ll kick things off with four outstanding pre-conference workshops relevant to both practice and research. The conference itself, from March 17-19, will have eight simultaneous rooms of programming, including 270 individual paper presentations, 71 data-blitz talks, 39 symposia, around 200 posters, and a number of special sessions.\nWe’re especially looking forward to our plenary speakers: Dr. Arthur Lupia will give the presidential plenary discussing his experience and research on science communication; a panel of AP-LS members will share their vast expertise on a variety of routes to increasing the impact of our science; and Prof. Kristin Henning will give our final plenary on race, adolescence, and the trauma caused by policing. These plenaries will help each of us to leave the conference with new ideas for how to do meaningful work in our field.\nKeep checking the conference website for updates, conference registration, and the link for hotel reservations:https://ap-ls.org/2022-apls-conference\nWe’re so excited to see everyone in Denver!\nSincerely,\nEmily Haney-Caron and Kelly McWilliams\n2022 AP-LS Conference Co-Chairs\n\n\nConference Update from the CAC\nDear AP-LS Members,\nWith March and the annual AP-LS conference not long away, please review three new critical announcements from the Conference Advisory Committee (CAC).\nChange to CEs:CEs for pre-conference programming will remain available; however, due to changes by APA,CONCEPT has recently informed that they will not be able to offer CEs for primary conference programming this year. The CAC is taking the issue seriously in working with the Continuing Education Committee and relevant presenters to attempt to secure CEs for limited programming (i.e., plenaries, award sessions, and AP-LS Committee sessions, but not symposia or paper sessions).\nImportant Registration Update:There will be no on-site conference registration permitted this year.All conference goers must register online in advance of the conference by March 15. This is necessary to ensure vaccination verification and smooth registration for everyone.\nMask Requirement:For the safety of all conference attendees,masks will be required in all conference spacesexcept when actively eating or drinking. This requirement extends to all conference sessions as well as conference social events.\nIn addition, all hotel employees are currently required to wear masks. The city of Denver has required everyone to wear masks indoors since mid-December. The city requirements are set to expire on February 3. Therefore, we will notify the membership regarding the general city requirements closer to the conference. However, the mask guidelines in conference spaces will not change based on city policy.\nThe CAC appreciates the collective fatigue with the ongoing pandemic, and we hope that members will remain patient as the CAC works with our dedicated conference co-chairs to ensure a safe, enjoyable, and professionally stimulating conference for all.\n\nNicholas Druhn\nChair of the Conference Advisory Committee\nDruhnn@icloud.com\n\n\nEssentialism and Legal System Working Group\nWe are putting together a working group of researchers who are interested in essentialism and/or generic language in legal settings. The goal of the group is to discuss past research, as well as future research questions and collaboration. If you are interested in becoming a part of this group or learning more, please provide your contact information in this survey:https://fiu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5uM9uXeXHcTxOFU.If you have any questions, please feel free to direct them to Dr. Colleen Berryessa (colleen.berryessa@rutgers.edu) or Dr. Deborah Goldfarb (deborah.goldfarb@fiu.edu).\n\n\nTTC Solicits Column Topics\nDo you have a teaching, training, or career strategy or topic that you want to share with the APLS membership? Have you ever thought about developing that idea into an essay for the Teaching column for the APLS newsletter? This is your opportunity to share your ideas and experiences. The APLS Teaching, Training, and Careers (TTC) committee is seeking solicitations for column topics. Send your ideas or brief abstract to Kim McClure, Chair of the TTC (ttc@ap-ls.org). \n\n\nSaleem Shah Early Career Award\nOn behalf of AAFP and AP-LS, theSaleemShahEarly Career Award Selection Committee is pleased to announce this year's recipient of theSaleemShahEarly Career Award:Dr. Ashley Batastini.\nSaleemShahwas one of the godfathers of our field. In 1968, he established law and mental health studies as a formal program priority for the National Institute of Mental Health and became the guide and mentor for a new generation of scholars who, through their empirical and theoretical work, transformed the field of law and mental health studies – among them Tom Grisso, John Monahan, Loren Roth, Bruce Sales, Henry Steadman, Linda Teplin, and David Wexler, to name but a few. GivenSaleem’s history of support and mentorship for so many in this field, AAFP and the American Psychology-Law Society established this award to focus on one of his major interests - nurturing the careers and talents of young forensic psychologists.\n\nThis award is given for demonstrating significant early career achievement in forensic psychology or related fields of law. Its recipients demonstrate a broad range of qualities, including the passionate development of relevant research and its application to public service, practice, and mentoring. The selection committee for this award was incredibly impressed by Dr. Batastini’s accomplishments and her ability to translate research into policy changes within correctional settings. The following list includes some of her noteworthy achievements (though there are so many more not listed here):\n\nShe completed her Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology at Texas Tech University in 2015, and is now an Assistant Professor in the Department of Counseling, Educational Psychology and Research at the University of Memphis.\nShe has 30 peer-reviewed articles, 2 edited books, 10 book chapters, and 2 treatment manuals.\nDr. Batastini serves on many editorial boards, including Criminal Justice and Behavior, Law and Human Behavior, and Psychological Services. She has also held leadership positions in several APA Divisions (including Division 41), and was recently elected President of APA Division 18 (Psychologists in Public Service).\nDr. Batastini’s letter writers described her as “a leading expert” in correctional treatment. She researched the psychological effects of restricted housing and then wrote the only training manual for treatment of individuals within restricted housing. Ashley began a pilot program providing treatment for women in segregation, a particularly underserved and under-researched subpopulation.\nHer focus on treatment in prison segregation units has also resulted in expertise in applying telehealth technology to forensic examinations and clinical treatment. Her 2021 meta-analysis comparing videoconference mental health services and in-person services as well as her 2019 survey of perceptions of telehealth in forensic evaluations have proved invaluable as many services became virtual during the pandemic.\nShe has been described by her colleagues as having an unparalleled intellectual energy, commitment to systematic research, and lucid thinking.\nDr. Batastini’s letter writers also emphasized her dedication to mentorship. One nominator expressed, “Like Saleem, she has extremely high standards and then helps her students to meet them.” Another nominator provided this example; “at the last in-person AP-LS conference (New Orleans, 2020), she had an impressive 8 students in attendance, all of whom were first-authored presenters or co-authors.”\n\nDr. Batastini was, to say the least, quite impressive. Please feel free to reach out and congratulate her atAshley.batastini@memphis.edu or learn more about her work at www.batastinipsychlab.com.\nI would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the great work of the selection committee. We had an incredible group of nominees this year- although this makes the reading the materials so inspiring, it also makes choosing only one winner incredibly difficult. Each member of the selection committee independently reviewed all nominations and related materials (letters of nomination, CVs, etc.). They rated the candidates and spent time as a committee discussing the nominees before making the final selection. A sincere thank you to each of them:\n\nJeff Kukucka, Ph.D. (past winner)\nStephane Sheperd, Ph.D. (past winner)\nRobin Watkins, Ph.D, ABPP\n\nSincerely,\nShannon Bader, Ph.D, ABPP\nPresident-Elect, American Academy of Forensic Psychology\n\n\nDivision 41 Election\nIn mid-April, an election will be held to fill the Division 41 positions ofPresident-Elect, Member-at-Large, and Council Representative. For more information about these positions, please see:http://www.apadivisions.org/division-41/leadership/executive-committee/index.aspx. You also can contact people currently in these positions for more information.\nWe are seeking nominations, including self-nominations, for these three positions. You must be a current AP-LS member to run for these positions, and you must also be an APA member to run for Council Representative. If you are interested in being considered for the election slate, please send the following materials to Allison Redlich (aredlich@gmu.edu), Chair of the AP-LS Nominations and Awards Committee:\n\nCV\nLetter(s) in support of the nominee\nStatement of interest (for self-nominations)\n\nIf you are nominating someone for the election slate, please ensure they are willing to run if they are selected to be on the ballot. All nominations are due byTuesday, February 1, 2022. All nominations and questions should be submitted to Allison Redlich (aredlich@gmu.edu).\n\n\nOn The Job or Postdoc Market?

It is important to recognize early career professionals as there are often a myriad of novel challenges and concerns that they are required to navigate. Many of these concerns are often introduced after their graduate studies are completed. These challenges may include obtaining licensure, establishing private practices, and seeking continued education credits.The ECP would like to further the mission of AP-LS to increase research, education, and training around diversity, equity, and inclusion.\nAre you a professional who identifiesas early career (per APA less than seven years sincegraduating) and currently practicing primarily as a practitioner?

Masked reviewers noted, “this researcher has clearly linked each theoretical question they pose in their studies to the relevant real world and legal implications… making it apparent throughout how important this work could be for improving the plea-bargaining experience for defendants. This is a very novel set of studies.” Reviewers appreciated Dr. Cardenas’s use of open science practices and were impressed at the comprehensiveness of the project, noting, “the author left no relevant stone unturned here. They found spaces in the literature where there were gaps or weaknesses and identified ways to fill these spaces that would be most influential… The researcher should be so pleased with this work.” Dr. Cardenas completed this dissertation under supervision of Dr. Saul Kassin.\nDr. Joe Avery (Princeton University) received Second Place for his dissertation, Legal Data: Bias in the Law, How Legal Technology Can Be Built to Help Correct For It. Masked reviewers noted about this dissertation, “deeply considered the ways in which technology may be brought to bear in order to reduce racial bias in the law. For anyone operating within the legal system, this dissertation has significant contributions to offer.” Reviewers were particularly impressed by the overall design and Dr. Avery’s “highly novel and a quite expert way,” of addressing his research questions, noting a project with, “numerous studies taken on with a high degree of rigor and attention to detail, both in design and reporting of results.” Dr. Avery completed this dissertation under supervision of Dr. Joel Cooper.\nDr. Amy Dezember(George Mason University), received Third Place for her dissertation, Examining Alford Pleas and the Presumption of Strong Evidence. Masked reviewers noted the dissertation, “involved an important topic of Alford pleas that has received very little research” filled with “interesting and novel information.” Reviewers were impressed by the “novel methodology with sound statistical approaches” that “involves real-world court data from Virginia and interviews of legal actors.” Dr. Dezember completed this dissertation under supervision of Dr. Allison Redlich.\n\n\nThe end of an Ira: Ira Packer retires from UMass Chan Medical School\nAndrea Dinsmore, Ashley Murray, Natalie Anumba, & Danielle Rynczak\nIt is with sadness for us, but joy for him, that we announce Dr. Ira Packer has retired from UMass Chan Medical School. He has been a pioneer in the field of forensic psychology and his legacy will undoubtedly remain for generations to come. In 1974, Dr. Packer graduated with his B.A. from Columbia University and went on to change the landscape of forensic psychology. After completing his Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania, he began his career as a forensic psychologist in Ann Arbor, Michigan. In 1985, he settled in Massachusetts, where he would spend the majority of his impressive career - over forty years - providing clinical and administrative oversight to facilities and programs in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Dr. Packer spent three years as the Massachusetts Assistant Commissioner for Forensic Mental Health from 1993 - 1996 and in his most recent work at UMass Chan Medical School, he served as the Director of the Forensic Evaluation Service, the Director of the Massachusetts Center of Excellence for Specialty Courts, the Co-Director of the Law and Psychiatry Program, and the Director of the UMMS Postdoctoral Residency Program in Forensic Psychology.\nTo read more about Dr. Ira’s successful career and the upcoming shift in leadership, please click here.\n\n\nAPA Council Meeting\nThe APA Council of Representatives held their semi-annual meeting virtually on February 24-26, 2022.

    "title": "Relationship",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Whether a forensic practitioner-client relationship exists depends on the circumstances and is determined by a number of factors which may include the information exchanged between the potential client and the forensic practitioner prior to, or at the initiation of, any contact or service, the nature of the interaction, and the purpose of the interaction.\nIn their work, forensic practitioners recognize that relationships are established with those who retain their services (e.g., retaining parties, employers, insurers, the court) and those with whom they interact (e.g., examinees, collateral contacts, research participants, students). Forensic practitioners recognize that associated obligations and duties vary as a function of the nature of the relationship.\n4.01 Responsibilities to Retaining Parties Most responsibilities to the retaining party attach only after the retaining party has requested and the forensic practitioner has agreed to render professional services and an agreement regarding compensation has been reached. Forensic practitioners are aware that there are some responsibilities, such as privacy, confidentiality, and privilege that may attach when the forensic practitioner agrees to consider whether a forensic practitioner-retaining party relationship shall be established. Forensic practitioners, prior to entering into a contract, may direct the potential retaining party not to reveal any confidential or privileged information as a way of protecting the retaining party’s interest in case a conflict exists as a result of pre-existing relationships.\nAt the initiation of any request for service, forensic practitioners seek to clarify the nature of the relationship and the services to be provided including the role of the forensic practitioner (e.g., trial consultant, forensic examiner, treatment provider, expert witness, research consultant); which person or entity is the client; the probable uses of the services provided or information obtained; and any limitations to privacy, confidentiality, or privilege.\n4.02 Multiple Relationships A multiple relationship occurs when a forensic practitioner is in a professional role with a person and, at the same time or at a subsequent time, is in a different role with the same person; is involved in a personal, fiscal, or other relationship with an adverse party; at the same time is in a relationship with a person closely associated with or related to the person with whom the forensic practitioner has the professional relationship; or offers or agrees to enter into another relationship in the future with the person or a person closely associated with or related to the person (EPPCC Standard 3.05).\nForensic practitioners strive to recognize the potential conflicts of interest and threats to objectivity inherent in multiple relationships. Forensic practitioners are encouraged to recognize that some personal and professional relationships may interfere with their ability to practice in a competent and impartial manner and they seek to minimize any detrimental effects by avoiding involvement in such matters whenever feasible or limiting their assistance in a manner that is consistent with professional obligations.\n4.02.01 Therapeutic-Forensic Role Conflicts Providing forensic and therapeutic psychological services to the same individual or closely related individuals involves multiple relationships that may impair objectivity and/or cause exploitation or other harm. Therefore, when requested or ordered to provide either concurrent or sequential forensic and therapeutic services, forensic practitioners are encouraged to disclose the potential risk and make reasonable efforts to refer the request to another qualified provider. If referral is not possible, the forensic practitioner is encouraged to consider the risks and benefits to all parties and to the legal system or entity likely to be impacted, the possibility of separating each service widely in time, seeking judicial review and direction, and consulting with knowledgeable colleagues. When providing both forensic and therapeutic services, forensic practitioners seek to minimize the potential negative effects of this circumstance (EPPCC Standard 3.05).\n4.02.02 Expert Testimony by Practitioners Providing Therapeutic Services Providing expert testimony about a patient who is a participant in a legal matter does not necessarily involve the practice of forensic psychology even when that testimony is relevant to a psycholegal issue before the decision-maker. For example, providing testimony on matters such as a patient’s reported history or other statements, mental status, diagnosis, progress, prognosis, and treatment would not ordinarily be considered forensic practice even when the testimony is related to a psycholegal issue before the decision-maker. In contrast, rendering opinions and providing testimony about a person on psycholegal issues (e.g., criminal responsibility, legal causation, proximate cause, trial competence, testamentary capacity, the relative merits of parenting arrangements) would ordinarily be considered the practice of forensic psychology.\nConsistent with their ethical obligations to base their opinions on information and techniques sufficient to substantiate their findings (EPPCC Standards 2.04, 9.01), forensic practitioners are encouraged to provide testimony only on those issues for which they have adequate foundation and only when a reasonable forensic practitioner engaged in similar circumstances would determine that the ability to make a proper decision is unlikely to be impaired. As with testimony regarding forensic examinees, the forensic practitioner strives to identify any substantive limitations that may affect the reliability and validity of the facts or opinions offered, and communicates these to the decision maker.\n4.02.03 Provision of Forensic Therapeutic Services Although some therapeutic services can be considered forensic in nature, the fact that therapeutic services are ordered by the court does not necessarily make them forensic.\nIn determining whether a therapeutic service should be considered the practice of forensic psychology, psychologists are encouraged to consider the potential impact of the legal context on treatment, the potential for treatment to impact the psycholegal issues involved in the case, and whether another reasonable psychologist in a similar position would consider the service to be forensic and these Guidelines to be applicable.\nTherapeutic services can have significant effects on current or future legal proceedings. Forensic practitioners are encouraged to consider these effects and minimize any unintended or negative effects on such proceedings or therapy when they provide therapeutic services in forensic contexts.\n4.03 Provision of Emergency Mental Health Services to Forensic Examinees When providing forensic examination services an emergency may arise that requires the practitioner to provide short term therapeutic services to the examinee in order to prevent imminent harm to the examinee or others. In such cases, the forensic practitioner is encouraged to limit disclosure of information and inform the retaining attorney, legal representative, or the court in an appropriate manner. Upon providing emergency treatment to examinees, forensic practitioners consider whether they can continue in a forensic role with that individual so that potential for harm to the recipient of services is avoided (EPPCC 3.04)."

    "text": "Forensic practitioners recognize their ethical obligations to maintain the confidentiality of information relating to a client or retaining party, except insofar as disclosure is consented to by the client or retaining party, or required or permitted by law (EPPCC Standard 4.01).\n\n\n8.01 Release of Information\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to recognize the importance of complying with properly noticed and served subpoenas or court orders directing release of information, or other legally proper consent from duly authorized persons, unless there is a legally valid reason to offer an objection. When in doubt about an appropriate response or course of action, forensic practitioners may seek assistance from the retaining client, retain and seek legal advice from their own attorney, or formally notify the drafter of the subpoena or order of their uncertainty.\n\n\n8.02 Access to Information\nIf requested, forensic practitioners seek to provide the retaining party access to, and a meaningful explanation of, all information that is in their records for the matter at hand, consistent with the relevant law, applicable codes of ethics and professional standards, and institutional rules and regulations. Forensic examinees typically are not provided access to the forensic practitioner’s records without the consent of the retaining party. Access to records by anyone other than the retaining party is governed by legal process, usually subpoena or court order, or by explicit consent of the retaining party. Forensic practitioners may charge a reasonable fee for the costs associated with the storage, reproduction, review, and provision of records.\n\n\n8.03 Acquiring Collateral and Third Party Information\nForensic practitioners strive to access information or records from collateral sources with the consent of the relevant attorney or the relevant party, or when otherwise authorized by law or court order.\n\n\n8.04 Use of Case Materials in Teaching, Continuing Education, and Other Scholarly Activities\nForensic practitioners using case materials for purposes of teaching, training, or research strive to present such information in a fair, balanced, and respectful manner. They attempt to protect the privacy of persons by disguising the confidential, personally identifiable information of all persons and entities who would reasonably claim a privacy interest; using only those aspects of the case available in the public domain; or obtaining consent from the relevant clients, parties, participants, and organizations to use the materials for such purposes (EPPCC Standard 4.07; also see Sections 11.06 and 11.07 of these guidelines)."

    "title": "Competence",
    "section": "",
    "text": "2.01 Scope of Competence\nWhen determining one’s competence to provide services in a particular matter, forensic practitioners may consider a variety of factors including the relative complexity and specialized nature of the service, relevant training and experience, the preparation and study they are able to devote to the matter, and the opportunity for consultation with a professional of established competence in the subject matter in question. Even with regard to subjects in which they are expert, forensic practitioners may choose to consult with colleagues.\n\n\n2.02 Gaining and Maintaining Competence\nCompetence can be acquired through various combinations of education, training, supervised experience, consultation, study, and professional experience. Forensic practitioners planning to provide services, teach, or conduct research involving populations, areas, techniques, or technologies that are new to them are encouraged to undertake relevant education, training, supervised experience, consultation, or study.\nForensic practitioners make ongoing efforts to develop and maintain their competencies (EPPCC Section 2.03). To maintain the requisite knowledge and skill, forensic practitioners keep abreast of developments in the fields of psychology and the law.\n\n\n2.03 Representing Competencies Consistent with the EPPCC\nForensic practitioners adequately and accurately inform all recipients of their services (e.g., attorneys, tribunals) about relevant aspects of the nature and extent of their experience, training, credentials, and qualifications, and how they were obtained (EPPCC Standard 5.01)\n\n\n2.04 Knowledge of the Legal System\nForensic practitioners recognize the importance of obtaining a fundamental and reasonable level of knowledge and understanding of the legal and professional standards, laws, rules, and precedents that govern their participation in legal proceedings and that guide the impact of their services on service recipients (EPPCC Standard 2.01).\nForensic practitioners aspire to manage their professional conduct in a manner that does not threaten or impair the rights of affected individuals. They may consult with, and refer others to, legal counsel on matters of law. Although they do not provide formal legal advice or opinions, forensic practitioners may provide information about the legal process to others based on their knowledge and experience. They strive to distinguish this from legal opinions, however, and encourage consultation with attorneys as appropriate.\n\n\n2.05 Knowledge of the Scientific Foundation for Opinions and Testimony\nForensic practitioners seek to provide opinions and testimony that are sufficiently based upon adequate scientific foundation, and reliable and valid principles and methods that have been applied appropriately to the facts of the case.\nWhen providing opinions and testimony that are based on novel or emerging principles and\nmethods, forensic practitioners seek to make known the status and limitations of these principles and methods.\n\n\n2.06 Knowledge of the Scientific Foundation for Teaching and Research\nForensic practitioners engage in teaching and research activities in which they have adequate knowledge, experience, and education (EPPCC Standard 2.01), and they acknowledge relevant limitations and caveats inherent in procedures and conclusions (EPPCC Standard 5.01).\n\n\n2.07 Considering the Impact of Personal Beliefs and Experience\nForensic practitioners recognize that their own cultures, attitudes, values, beliefs, opinions, or biases may affect their ability to practice in a competent and impartial manner. When such factors may diminish their ability to practice in a competent and impartial manner, forensic practitioners may take steps to correct or limit such effects, decline participation in the matter, or limit their participation in a manner that is consistent with professional obligations.\n\n\n2.08 Appreciation of Individual and Group Differences\nWhen scientific or professional knowledge in the discipline of psychology establishes that an understanding of factors associated with age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, language, socioeconomic status, or other relevant individual and cultural differences affects implementation or use of their services or research, forensic practitioners consider the boundaries of their expertise, make an appropriate referral if indicated, or gain the necessary training, experience, consultation, or supervision (EPPCC Standard 2.01, American Psychological Association, 2003; American Psychological Association, 2004; American Psychological Association, 2011c; American Psychological Association, in press; American Psychological Association Task Force on Guidelines for Assessment and Treatment of Persons with Disabilities, 2011).\nForensic practitioners strive to understand how factors associated with age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, language, socioeconomic status, or other relevant individual and cultural differences may affect and be related to the basis for people’s contact and involvement with the legal system.\nForensic practitioners do not engage in unfair discrimination based on such factors or on any basis proscribed by law (EPPCC Standard 3.01). They strive to take steps to correct or limit the effects of such factors on their work, decline participation in the matter, or limit their participation in a manner that is consistent with professional obligations.\n\n\n2.09 Appropriate Use of Services and Products\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to make reasonable efforts to guard against misuse of their services and exercise professional discretion in addressing such misuses."

    "section": "",
    "text": "9.01 Use of Appropriate Methods\nForensic practitioners strive to utilize appropriate methods and procedures in their work. When performing examinations, treatment, consultation, educational activities or scholarly investigations, forensic practitioners seek to maintain integrity by examining the issue or problem at hand from all reasonable perspectives and seek information that will differentially test plausible rival hypotheses.\n\n\n9.02 Use of Multiple Sources of Information\nForensic practitioners ordinarily avoid relying solely on one source of data, and corroborate important data whenever feasible (American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, in press). When relying upon data that have not been corroborated, forensic practitioners seek to make known the uncorroborated status of the data, any associated strengths and limitations, and the reasons for relying upon the data.\n\n\n9.03 Opinions Regarding Persons Not Examined\nForensic practitioners recognize their obligations to only provide written or oral evidence about the psychological characteristics of particular individuals when they have sufficient information or data to form an adequate foundation for those opinions or to substantiate their findings (EPPCC Standard 9.01). Forensic practitioners seek to make reasonable efforts to obtain such information or data, and they document their efforts to obtain it. When it is not possible or feasible to examine individuals about whom they are offering an opinion, forensic practitioners strive to make clear the impact of such limitations on the reliability and validity of their professional products, opinions, or testimony.\nWhen conducting a record review or providing consultation or supervision that does not warrant an individual examination, forensic practitioners seek to identify the sources of information on which they are basing their opinions and recommendations, including any substantial limitations to their opinions and recommendations."

    "title": "Fees",
    "section": "",
    "text": "5.01 Determining Fees\nWhen determining fees forensic practitioners may consider salient factors such as their experience providing the service, the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, the skill required to perform the service, the fee customarily charged for similar forensic services, the likelihood that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment, the time limitations imposed by the client or circumstances, the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client, the client’s ability to pay for the service, and any legal requirements.\n\n\n5.02 Fee Arrangements\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to make clear to the client the likely cost of services whenever it is feasible, and make appropriate provisions in those cases in which the costs of services is greater than anticipated or the client’s ability to pay for services changes in some way.\nForensic practitioners seek to avoid undue influence that might result from financial compensation or other gains. Because of the threat to impartiality presented by the acceptance of contingent fees and associated legal prohibitions, forensic practitioners strive to avoid providing professional services on the basis of contingent fees. Letters of protection, financial guarantees, and other security for payment of fees in the future are not considered contingent fees unless payment is dependent on the outcome of the matter.\n\n\n5.03 Pro Bono Services\nForensic psychologists recognize that some persons may have limited access to legal services as a function of financial disadvantage and strive to contribute a portion of their professional time for little or no compensation or personal advantage (EPPCC Principle E)."

    "text": "1.01 Integrity Forensic practitioners strive for accuracy, honesty, and truthfulness in the science, teaching, and practice of forensic psychology and they strive to resist partisan pressures to provide services in any ways that might tend to be misleading or inaccurate.\n1.02 Impartiality and Fairness When offering expert opinion to be relied upon by a decision maker, providing forensic therapeutic services, or teaching or conducting research, forensic practitioners strive for accuracy, impartiality, fairness, and independence (EPPCC Standard 2.01). Forensic practitioners recognize the adversarial nature of the legal system and strive to treat all participants and weigh all data, opinions, and rival hypotheses impartially.\nWhen conducting forensic examinations, forensic practitioners strive to be unbiased and impartial, and avoid partisan presentation of unrepresentative, incomplete, or inaccurate evidence that might mislead finders of fact. This guideline does not preclude forceful presentation of the data and reasoning upon which a conclusion or professional product is based.\nWhen providing educational services, forensic practitioners seek to represent alternative perspectives, including data, studies, or evidence on both sides of the question, in an accurate, fair and professional manner, and strive to weigh and present all views, facts, or opinions impartially.\nWhen conducting research, forensic practitioners seek to represent results in a fair and impartial manner. Forensic practitioners strive to utilize research designs and scientific methods that adequately and fairly test the questions at hand, and they attempt to resist partisan pressures to develop designs or report results in ways that might be misleading or unfairly bias the results of a test, study, or evaluation.\n1.03 Avoiding Conflicts of Interest Forensic practitioners refrain from taking on a professional role when personal, scientific, professional, legal, financial, or other interests or relationships could reasonably be expected to impair their impartiality, competence, or effectiveness, or expose others with whom a professional relationship exists to harm (EPPCC Standard 3.06).\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to identify, make known, and address real or apparent conflicts of interest in an attempt to maintain the public confidence and trust, discharge professional obligations, and maintain responsibility, impartiality, and accountability (EPPCC Standard 3.06). Whenever possible, such conflicts are revealed to all parties as soon as they become known to the psychologist. Forensic practitioners consider whether a prudent and competent forensic practitioner engaged in similar circumstances would determine that the ability to make a proper decision is likely to become impaired under the immediate circumstances.\nWhen a conflict of interest is determined to be manageable, continuing services are provided and documented in a way to manage the conflict, maintain accountability, and preserve the trust of relevant others (also see Section 4.02 below)."

Beyond this, remote technologies have become a necessity following the COVID-19 pandemic for sustaining clinical practices and safely engaging clients. VCT is exploding across the globe, with many considering it as a sort of savior in the fight to resolve the mental health crisis.\nGiven the high demand for pre-trial evaluations (Antonacci, et al., 2008; Deslich et al., 2013), rural location of many correctional facilities, and increased risk of infection in total confinement, the use of VCT is increasingly used to assess and treat justice-involved persons.

Panelists will cover topics including establishing a remote jail-based competency restoration program, improving the science of conducting and reporting forensic telepsychology initiatives, overcoming unique barriers to privacy and confidentiality in carceral settings, developing an infrastructure for telehealth networks, and drafting discipline-specific best practice guidelines.

When responding to discovery requests and providing sworn testimony, forensic practitioners strive to have readily available for inspection all data which they considered, regardless of whether the data supports their opinion, subject to and consistent with court order, relevant rules of evidence, test security issues, and professional standards (American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, in press; American Psychological Association Committee on Legal Issues, 2006; Bank & Packer, 2007; Golding, 1990).\nWhen providing reports and other sworn statements or testimony in any form, forensic practitioners strive to present their conclusions, evidence, opinions, or other professional products in a fair manner. Forensic practitioners do not, by either commission or omission, participate in misrepresentation of their evidence, nor do they participate in partisan attempts to avoid, deny or subvert the presentation of evidence contrary to their own position or opinion (EPPCC Standard 5.01). This does not preclude forensic practitioners from forcefully presenting the data and reasoning upon which a conclusion or professional product is based.\n\n\n11.02 Differentiating Observations, Inferences, and Conclusions\nIn their communications, forensic practitioners strive to distinguish observations, inferences, and conclusions. Forensic practitioners are encouraged to explain the relationship between their expert opinions and the legal issues and facts of the case at hand.\n\n\n11.03 Disclosing Sources of Information and Bases of Opinions\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to disclose all sources of information obtained in the course of their professional services, and to identify the source of each piece of information that was considered and relied upon in formulating a particular conclusion, opinion or other professional product.\n\n\n11.04 Comprehensive and Accurate Presentation of Opinions in Reports and Testimony\nConsistent with relevant law and rules of evidence, when providing professional reports and other sworn statements or testimony, forensic practitioners strive to offer a complete statement of all relevant opinions that they formed within the scope of their work on the case, the basis and reasoning underlying the opinions, the salient data or other information that was considered in forming the opinions, and an indication of any additional evidence that may be used in support of the opinions to be offered. The specific substance of forensic reports is determined by the type of psycholegal issue at hand as well as relevant laws or rules in the jurisdiction in which the work is completed.\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to limit discussion of background information that does not bear directly upon the legal purpose of the examination or consultation. Forensic practitioners avoid offering information that is irrelevant and that does not provide a substantial basis of support for their opinions, except when required by law (EPPCC Standard 4.04).\n\n\n11.05 Commenting Upon Other Professionals and Participants in Legal Proceedings\nWhen evaluating or commenting upon the work or qualifications of other professionals involved in legal proceedings, forensic practitioners seek to represent their disagreements in a professional and respectful tone, and base them on a fair examination of the data, theories, standards and opinions of the other expert or party.\nWhen describing or commenting upon clients, examinees, or other participants in legal proceedings, forensic practitioners strive to do so in a fair and impartial manner. Forensic practitioners strive to report the representations, opinions, and statements of clients, examinees, or other participants in a fair and impartial manner.\n\n\n11.06 Out of Court Statements\nOrdinarily, forensic practitioners seek to avoid making detailed public (out-of-court) statements about legal proceedings in which they have been involved. However, sometimes public statements may serve important goals such as educating the public about the role of forensic practitioners in the legal system, the appropriate practice of forensic psychology, and psychological and legal issues that are relevant to the matter at hand. When making public statements, forensic practitioners refrain from releasing private, confidential, or privileged information, and attempt to protect persons from harm, misuse, or misrepresentation as a result of their statements (EPPCC Standard 4.05).\n\n\n11.07 Commenting Upon Legal Proceedings\nForensic practitioners strive to address particular legal proceedings in publications or communications only to the extent that the information relied upon is part of a public record, or when consent for that use has been properly obtained from any party holding any relevant privilege (also see Section 8.04).\nWhen offering public statements about specific cases in which they have not been involved, forensic practitioners offer opinions for which there is sufficient information or data and make clear the limitations of their statements and opinions resulting from having had no direct knowledge of or involvement with the case (EPPCC Standard 9.01)."

    "text": "The final version of the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists, prepared by the AP-LS Committee on the Revision of the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology, was adopted by APA Council of Representatives on Aug. 3, 2011.\nThe guidelines originally appeared in American Psychologist and are available to download.\n Download Forensic Guidelines \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAPA has approved an extension of the current APA specialty Guidelines in Forensic Psychology through December 31, 2026.\n\n\nFor other professional guidelines from APA, go here\n\nApplicationDefinitions & TerminologyBackground & History\n\n\nThe Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists applies as follows:\nFor the purposes of these Guidelines, forensic psychology refers to professional practice by any psychologist working within any sub-discipline of psychology (e.g., clinical, developmental, social, cognitive) when applying the scientific, technical, or specialized knowledge of psychology to the law to assist in addressing legal, contractual, and administrative matters. Application of the Guidelines does not depend on the practitioner’s typical areas of practice or expertise, but rather on the service provided in the case at hand. These Guidelines apply in all matters in which psychologists provide expertise to judicial, administrative, and educational systems including, but not limited to, examining or treating persons in anticipation of or subsequent to legal, contractual, administrative, proceedings; offering expert opinion about psychological issues in the form of amicus briefs or testimony to judicial, legislative or administrative bodies; acting in an adjudicative capacity; serving as a trial consultant or otherwise offering expertise to attorneys, the courts, or others; conducting research in connection with, or in the anticipation of, litigation; or involvement in educational activities of a forensic nature.\n\n\nFor the purposes of these Guidelines:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory of the Guidelines\nThe previous version of the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists (Committee on Ethical Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists, 1991) was approved by the American Psychology-Law Society, Division 41 of the American Psychological Association, and the American Academy of Forensic Psychology in 1991. The current revision, now called the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology (referred to as Guidelines throughout this document), replace the 1991 Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists.\n\n\nRevision Process\nThis revision of the Guidelines was coordinated by the Committee for the Revision of the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology, which was established by the American Academy of Forensic Psychology and the American Psychology-Law Society (Division 41 of the American Psychological Association) in 2002 and operated through 2011. This Committee consisted of two representatives from each organization (Solomon Fulero, PhD, JD, Stephen Golding, PhD, ABPP, Lisa Piechowski, PhD, ABPP, Christina Studebaker, PhD) a Chairperson (Randy Otto, PhD, ABPP), and a liaison from APA Division 42 (Jeffrey Younggren, PhD, ABPP).\nThis document was revised in accordance with American Psychological Association Rule 30.08 and the APA policy document Criteria for the development and evaluation of practice guidelines (APA, 2001). The Committee posted announcements regarding the revision process to relevant electronic discussion lists and professional publications (i.e., Psylaw-L email listserve, American Academy of Forensic Psychology listserve, American Psychology-Law Society Newsletter).\nIn addition, an electronic discussion list devoted solely to issues concerning revision of the Guidelines was operated between December 2002 and July 2007, followed by establishment of an e-mail address in February 2008 (sgfp@yahoo.com). Individuals were invited to provide input and commentary on the existing Guidelines and proposed revisions via these means. In addition, two public meetings were held throughout the revision process at biennial meetings of the American Psychology-Law Society.\nUpon development of a draft that the Revisions Committee deemed suitable, the revised Guidelines were submitted for review to the Executive Committee of the American Psychology-Law Society and Division 41 of the American Psychological Association, and to the American Board of Forensic Psychology.\nOnce the revised Guidelines were approved by these two organizations, they were submitted to the American Psychological Association for review, commentary, and acceptance, consistent with the American Psychological Association’s Criteria for Practice Guideline Development and Evaluation (Committee on Professional Practice and Standards, 2001) and Rule 30-8. They were subsequently revised by the Revisions Committee and were adopted by the American Psychological Association Council of Representatives on [insert date here].\n\n\nDevelopers and Support\nThe Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology were developed by the American Psychology-Law Society (Division 41 of the American Psychological Association) and the American Academy of Forensic Psychology.\n\n\nCurrent Status\nThese Guidelines are scheduled to expire [insert date here]. After this date, users are encouraged to contact the American Psychological Association Practice Directorate to confirm that this document remains in effect.\nSGFP Guidelines originally adopted in 1991 (PDF, 64KB)\n Download \nJanuary 2006 Draft of the Revised SGFP Guidelines (PDF, 87KB)\n Download \nFebruary 2008 Draft of the Revised SGFP Guidelines (PDF, 99KB)\n Download \nSeptember 2008 Draft of the Revised SGFP Guidelines (PDF, 91KB)\n Download \nAugust 2010 Draft of the Revised SGFP Guidelines (PDF, 169KB)\n Download"

    "text": "3.01 Provision of Services\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to seek explicit agreements that define the scope of, time-frame of, and compensation for their services. In the event that a client breaches the contract or acts in a way that would require the practitioner to violate ethical, legal or professional obligations, the forensic practitioner may terminate the relationship.\nForensic practitioners strive to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in providing agreed-upon and reasonably anticipated services. Forensic practitioners are not bound, however, to provide services not reasonably anticipated when retained, nor to provide every possible aspect or variation of service. Instead, forensic practitioners may exercise professional discretion in determining the extent and means by which services are provided and agreements are fulfilled.\n\n\n3.02 Responsiveness\nForensic practitioners seek to manage their workloads so that services can be provided thoroughly, competently, and promptly. They recognize that acting with reasonable promptness, however, does not require the forensic practitioner to acquiesce to service demands not reasonably anticipated at the time the service was requested, nor does it require the forensic practitioner to provide services if the client has not acted in a manner consistent with existing agreements, including payment of fees.\n\n\n3.03 Communication\nForensic practitioners strive to keep their clients reasonably informed about the status of their services, comply with their clients’ reasonable requests for information, and consult with their clients about any substantial limitation on their conduct or performance that may arise when they reasonably believe that their clients expect a service that is not consistent with their professional obligations. Forensic practitioners attempt to keep their clients reasonably informed regarding new facts, opinions, or other potential evidence that may be relevant and applicable.\n\n\n3.04 Termination of Services\nThe forensic practitioner seeks to carry through to conclusion all matters undertaken for a client unless the forensic practitioner-client relationship is terminated. When a forensic practitioner’s employment is limited to a specific matter, the relationship may terminate when the matter has been resolved, anticipated services have been completed, or the agreement has been violated."

    "text": "In the past 50 years forensic psychological practice had expanded dramatically. The American Psychological Association has a division devoted to matters of law and psychology (APA Division 41, the American Psychology-Law Society), a number of scientific journals devoted to interactions between psychology and the law exist (e.g., Law and Human Behavior, Psychology, Public Policy and Law, Behavioral Sciences and the Law), and a number of key texts have been published and undergone multiple revisions (e.g., Grisso, 1986, 2003; Melton, Petrila, Poythress, & Slobogin, 1987, 1997; Melton, Petrila, Poythress, Slobogin, Lyons, & Otto, 2007; Rogers, 1988, 1997, 2008).\nIn addition, training in forensic psychology is available in pre-doctoral, internship and post-doctoral settings, and the American Psychological Association recognized forensic psychology as a specialty in 2001, with subsequent re-certification in 2008.\nBecause the practice of forensic psychology differs in important ways from more traditional practice areas (Monahan, 1980) the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists were developed and published in 1991 (Committee on Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists, 1991). Because of continued developments in the field in the ensuing 20 years, forensic practitioners’ ongoing need for guidance, and policy requirements of the American Psychological Association, the 1991 Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists were revised, with the intent of benefiting forensic practitioners and recipients of their services alike.\nThe goals of these Guidelines are to improve the quality of forensic psychological services:\n\nenhance the practice and facilitate the systematic development of forensic psychology\nencourage a high level of quality in professional practice\nencourage forensic practitioners to acknowledge and respect the rights of those they serve\n\nThese Guidelines are intended for use by psychologists when engaged in the practice of forensic psychology as described below, and may also provide guidance on professional conduct to the legal system, and other organizations and professions.\nFor the purposes of these Guidelines, forensic psychology refers to professional practice by any psychologist working within any sub-discipline of psychology (e.g., clinical, developmental, social, cognitive) when applying the scientific, technical, or specialized knowledge of psychology to the law to assist in addressing legal, contractual, and administrative matters. Application of the Guidelines does not depend on the practitioner’s typical areas of practice or expertise, but rather on the service provided in the case at hand.\nThese Guidelines apply in all matters in which psychologists provide expertise to judicial, administrative, and educational systems including, but not limited to:\n\nexamining or treating persons in anticipation of or subsequent to legal, contractual, administrative, proceedings\noffering expert opinion about psychological issues in the form of amicus briefs or testimony to judicial, legislative or administrative bodies\nacting in an adjudicative capacity; serving as a trial consultant or otherwise offering expertise to attorneys, the courts, or others\nconducting research in connection with, or in the anticipation of, litigation\nor involvement in educational activities of a forensic nature\n\nPsychological practice is not considered forensic solely because the conduct takes place in, or the product is presented in, a tribunal or other judicial, legislative, or administrative forum.\n\nFor example, when a party (such as a civilly or criminally detained individual) or another individual (such as a child whose parents are involved in divorce proceedings) is ordered into treatment with a practitioner, that treatment is not necessarily the practice of forensic psychology. In addition, psychological testimony that is solely based on the provision of psychotherapy and does not include psycholegal opinions is not ordinarily considered forensic practice.\n\nFor the purposes of these Guidelines, “forensic practitioner” refers to a psychologist when engaged in the practice of forensic psychology as described above. Such professional conduct is considered forensic from the time the practitioner reasonably expects to, agrees to, or is legally mandated to, provide expertise on an explicitly psycholegal issue.\nThe provision of forensic services may include a wide variety of psycholegal roles and functions.\n\nFor example, as researchers, forensic practitioners may participate in the collection and dissemination of data that are relevant to various legal issues.\n\n\nAs advisors, forensic practitioners may provide an attorney with an informed understanding of the role that psychology can play in the case at hand.\n\n\nAs consultants, forensic practitioners may explain the practical implications of relevant research, examination findings, and the opinions of other psycholegal experts.\n\n\nAs examiners, forensic practitioners may assess an individual’s functioning and report findings and opinions to the attorney, a legal tribunal, an employer, an insurer, or others (American Psychological Association, 2010; American Psychological Association, 2011a).\n\n\nAs treatment providers, forensic practitioners may provide therapeutic services tailored to the issues and context of a legal proceeding.\n\n\nAs mediators or negotiators, forensic practitioners may serve in a third-party neutral role and assist parties in resolving disputes.\n\n\nAs arbiters, special masters, or case managers with decision-making authority, forensic practitioners may serve parties, attorneys, and the courts (American Psychological Association, 2011b).\n\nThese guidelines are informed by the American Psychological Association’s (APA’s) Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct (hereinafter referred to as the EPPCC; APA, 2002). The term guidelines refers to statements that suggest or recommend speciﬁc professional behavior, endeavors, or conduct for psychologists. Guidelines differ from standards in that standards are mandatory and may be accompanied by an enforcement mechanism. Guidelines are aspiration in intent. They are intended to facilitate the continued systematic development of the profession and facilitate a high level of practice by psychologists. Guidelines are not intended to be mandatory or exhaustive and may not be applicable to every professional situation. They are not deﬁnitive, and they are not intended to take precedence over the judgment of psychologists.\nAs such, the Guidelines are advisory in areas in which the forensic practitioner has discretion to exercise professional judgment that is not prohibited or mandated by the EPPCC or applicable law, rules, or regulations. The Guidelines neither add obligations to nor eliminate obligations from the EPPCC, but provide additional guidance for psychologists. The modifiers used in the Guidelines (e.g., reasonably, appropriate, potentially) are included in recognition of the need for professional judgment on the part of forensic practitioners; ensure applicability across the broad range of activities conducted by forensic practitioners; and reduce the likelihood of enacting an inflexible set of guidelines that might be inapplicable as forensic practice evolves. The use of these modifiers, and the recognition of the role of professional discretion and judgment, also reflects that forensic practitioners are likely to encounter facts and circumstances not anticipated by the Guidelines and they may have to act upon uncertain or incomplete evidence. The Guidelines may provide general or conceptual guidance in such circumstances. The Guidelines do not, however, exhaust the legal, professional, moral and ethical considerations that inform forensic practitioners, for no complex activity can be completely defined by legal rules, codes of conduct, and aspirational guidelines.\nThe Guidelines are not intended to serve as a basis for disciplinary action or civil or criminal liability. The standard of care is established by a competent authority not by the Guidelines. No ethical, licensure, or other administrative action or remedy, nor any other cause of action, should be taken solely on the basis of a forensic practitioner acting in a manner consistent or inconsistent with these Guidelines.\nIn cases in which a competent authority references the Guidelines when formulating standards, the authority should consider that the Guidelines attempt to identify a high level of quality in forensic practice. Competent practice is defined as the conduct of a reasonably prudent forensic practitioner engaged in similar activities in similar circumstances. Professional conduct evolves and may be viewed along a continuum of adequacy, and “minimally competent” and “best possible” are usually different points along that continuum.\nThe Guidelines are designed to be national in scope and are intended to be consistent with state and federal law. In cases in which a conflict between legal and professional obligations occur, forensic practitioners make known their commitment to the EPPCC and the Guidelines and take steps to achieve an appropriate resolution consistent with the EPPCC and Guidelines.\nThe format of the Guidelines is different from most other practice guidelines developed under the auspices of APA. This reflects the history of the Guidelines as well as the fact that the Guidelines are considerably broader in scope than any other APA-developed guidelines. Indeed, these are the only APA-approved guidelines that address a complete specialty practice area. Despite this difference in format, the Guidelines function as all other APA guideline documents.\nThis  document  replaces the 1991 Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists which were approved by the American Psychology-Law Society, Division 41 of the American Psychological Association and the American Board of Forensic Psychology. The current revision has also been approved by the Council of Representatives of the American Psychological Association. Appendix I includes a discussion of the revision process, enactment, and current status of these Guidelines. Appendix II includes definitions and terminology as used for the purposes of these Guidelines."

    "text": "10.01 Focus on Legally Relevant Factors\nForensic examiners seek to assist the trier of fact to understand evidence or determine a fact in issue, and they provide information that is most relevant to the psycholegal issue. In reports and testimony forensic practitioners typically provide information about examinees’ functional abilities, capacities, knowledge, and beliefs, and address their opinions and recommendations to the identified psycholegal issues (American Bar Association and American Psychological Assocation, 2008; Grisso, 1986, 2003; Heilbrun, Marczyk, DeMatteo, & Mack-Allen, 2007).\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to consider the problems that may arise by using a clinical diagnosis in some forensic contexts, and consider and qualify their opinions and testimony appropriately.\n\n\n10.02 Selection and Use of Assessment Procedures\nForensic practitioners use assessment procedures in the manner and for the purposes that are appropriate in light of the research on or evidence of their usefulness and proper application (EPPCC Standard 9.02, American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, in press9). This includes assessment techniques, interviews, tests, instruments, and other procedures and their administration, adaptation, scoring, and interpretation, including computerized scoring and interpretation systems.\nForensic practitioners use assessment instruments whose validity and reliability have been established for use with members of the population assessed. When such validity and reliability have not been established, forensic practitioners consider and describe the strengths and limitations of their findings. Forensic practitioners use assessment methods that are appropriate to an examinee’s language preference and competence, unless the use of an alternative language is relevant to the assessment issues (EPPCC Standard 9.02).\nAssessment in forensic contexts differs from assessment in therapeutic contexts in important ways that forensic practitioners strive to take into account when conducting forensic examinations. Forensic practitioners seek to consider the strengths and limitations of employing traditional assessment procedures in forensic examinations (American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, in press). Given the stakes involved in forensic contexts, forensic practitioners strive to ensure the integrity and security of test materials and results (American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, in press9).\nWhen the validity of an assessment technique has not been established in the forensic context or setting in which it is being used, the forensic practitioner seeks to describe the strengths and limitations of any test results and explain the extrapolation of these data to the forensic context Because of the many differences between forensic and therapeutic contexts, forensic practitioners consider and seek to make known that some examination results may warrant substantially different interpretation when administered in forensic contexts (American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, in press).\nForensic practitioners consider and seek to make known that forensic examination results can be affected by factors unique to, or differentially present in, forensic contexts including response style, voluntariness of participation, and situational stress associated with involvement in forensic or legal matters (American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, in press).\n\n\n10.03 Appreciation of Individual Differences\nWhen interpreting assessment results forensic practitioners consider the purpose of the assessment as well as the various test factors, test-taking abilities, and other characteristics of the person being assessed, such as situational, personal, linguistic, and cultural differences that might affect their judgments or reduce the accuracy of their interpretations (EPPCC Standard 9.06). Forensic practitioners strive to identify any significant strengths and limitations of their procedures and interpretations.\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to consider how the assessment process may be impacted by any disability an examinee is experiencing, make accommodations as possible, and consider such when interpreting and communicating the results of the assessment (American Psychological Association Task Force on Guidelines for Assessment and treatment of Persons with Disabilities, 2011).\n\n\n10.04 Consideration of Assessment Settings\nIn order to maximize the validity of assessment results, forensic practitioners strive to conduct evaluations in settings that provide adequate comfort, safety and privacy.\n\n\n10.05 Provision of Assessment Feedback\nForensic practitioners take reasonable steps to explain assessment results to the examinee or a designated representative in language they can understand (EPPCC Standard 9.10). In those circumstances in which communication about assessment results is precluded, the forensic practitioner explains this to the examinee in advance (EPPCC Standard 9.10).\nForensic practitioners seek to provide information about professional work in a manner consistent with professional and legal standards for the disclosure of test data or results, interpretation of data, and the factual bases for conclusions.\n\n\n10.06 Documentation and Compilation of Data Considered\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to recognize the importance of documenting all data they consider with enough detail and quality to allow for reasonable judicial scrutiny and adequate discovery by all parties. This documentation includes, but is not limited to, letters and consultations; notes, recordings, and transcriptions; assessment and test data, scoring reports and interpretations; and all other records in any form or medium that were created or exchanged in connection with a matter.\nWhen contemplating third party observation or audio/video-recording of examinations forensic practitioners strive to consider any law that may control such matters, the need for transparency and documentation, and the potential impact of observation or recording on the validity of the examination and test security (American Psychological Association Committee on Psychological Tests and Assessment, 2007).\n\n\n10.07 Provision of Documentation\nPursuant to proper subpoenas or court orders, or other legally proper consent from authorized persons, forensic practitioners seek to make available all documentation described in 10.05, all financial records related to the matter, and any other records including reports (and draft reports if they have been provided to a party, attorney, or other entity for review), that might reasonably be related to the opinions to be expressed.\n\n\n10.08 Recordkeeping\nForensic practitioners establish and maintain a system of recordkeeping and professional communication (EPPCC Standard 6.01; American Psychological Association, 2007), and attend to relevant laws and rules. When indicated by the extent of the rights, liberties, and properties that may be at risk, the complexity of the case, the amount and legal significance of unique evidence in the care and control of the forensic practitioner, and the likelihood of future appeal, forensic practitioners strive to inform the retaining party of the limits of recordkeeping times. If requested to do so, forensic practitioners consider maintaining such records until notified that all appeals in the matter have been exhausted, or sending a copy of any unique components/aspects of the record in their care and control to the retaining party before destruction of the record."

    "text": "In forensic psychology practice conflicting responsibilities and demands may be encountered. When conflicts occur, forensic practitioners seek to make the conflict known to the relevant parties or agencies, and consider the rights and interests of the relevant parties or agencies in their attempts to resolve the conflict.\n\n\n7.01 Conflicts with Legal Authority\nWhen their responsibilities conflict with law, regulations, or other governing legal authority, forensic practitioners make known their commitment to the EPPCC, and take steps to resolve the conflict. In situations in which the EPPCC or Guidelines are in conflict with the law, attempts to resolve the conflict are made in accordance with the EPPCC (EPPCC Standard 1.02).\nWhen the conflict cannot be resolved by such means, forensic practitioners may adhere to the requirements of the law, regulations, or other governing legal authority, but only to the extent required and not in any way that violates a person’s human rights (EPPCC Standard 1.03).\nForensic practitioners are encouraged to consider the appropriateness of complying with court orders when such compliance creates potential conflicts with professional standards of practice.\n\n\n7.02 Conflicts with Organizational Demands\nWhen the demands of an organization with which they are affiliated or for whom they are working conflict with their professional responsibilities and obligations, forensic practitioners strive to clarify the nature of the conflict and, to the extent feasible, resolve the conflict in a way consistent with professional obligations and responsibilities (EPPCC Standard 1.03).\n\n\n7.03 Resolving Ethical Issues with Fellow Professionals\nWhen an apparent or potential ethical violation has caused, or is likely to cause, substantial harm, forensic practitioners are encouraged to take action appropriate to the situation and consider a number of factors including the nature and the immediacy of the potential harm; applicable privacy, confidentiality, and privilege; how the rights of the relevant parties may be affected by a particular course of action; and any other legal or ethical obligations (EPPCC Standard 1.04). Steps to resolve perceived ethical conflicts may include, but are not be limited to, obtaining the consultation of knowledgeable colleagues, obtaining the advice of independent counsel, and conferring directly with the client.\nWhen forensic practitioners believe there may have been an ethical violation by another professional, an attempt is made to resolve the issue by bringing it to the attention of that individual, if that attempt does not violate any rights or privileges that may be involved, and if an informal resolution appears appropriate (EPPCC Standard 1.04). If this does not result in a satisfactory resolution, the forensic practitioner may have to take further action appropriate to the situation, including making a report to third parties of the perceived ethical violation (EPPCC Standard 1.05). In most instances, in order to minimize unforeseen risks to the party’s rights in the legal matter, forensic practitioners consider consulting with the client before attempting to resolve a perceived ethical violation with another professional."

    "text": "Because substantial rights, liberties, and properties are often at risk in forensic matters, and because the methods and procedures of forensic practitioners are complex and may not be accurately anticipated by the recipients of forensic services, forensic practitioners strive to inform service recipients about the nature and parameters of the services to be provided (EPPCC Standards 3.04, 3.10).\n\n\n6.01 Timing and Substance\nForensic practitioners strive to inform clients, examinees, and others who are the recipients of forensic services as soon as is feasible about the nature and extent of reasonably anticipated forensic services.\nIn determining what information to impart, forensic practitioners are encouraged to consider a variety of factors including the person’s experience or training in psychological and legal matters of the type involved and whether the person is represented by counsel. When questions or uncertainties remain after they have made the effort to explain the necessary information, forensic practitioners may recommend that the person seek legal advice.\n\n\n6.02 Communication with Those Seeking to Retain a Forensic Practitioner\nAs part of the initial process of being retained, or as soon thereafter as previously unknown information becomes available, forensic practitioners strive to disclose to the retaining party information that would reasonably be anticipated to affect a decision to retain or continue the services of the forensic practitioner.\nThis disclosure may include, but is not limited to, the fee structure for anticipated services; prior and current personal or professional activities, obligations and relationships that would reasonably lead to the fact or the appearance of a conflict of interest; the forensic practitioner’s knowledge, skill, experience, and education relevant to the forensic services being considered, including any significant limitations; and the scientific bases and limitations of the methods and procedures which are expected to be employed.\n\n\n6.03 Communication with Forensic Examinees\nForensic practitioners inform examinees about the nature and purpose of the examination (EPPCC Standard 9.03; American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, 1999). Such information may include the purpose, nature, and anticipated use of the examination; who will have access to the information; associated limitations on privacy, confidentiality, and privilege including who is authorized to release or access the information contained in the forensic practitioner’s records; the voluntary or involuntary nature of participation, including potential consequences of participation or non-participation, if known; and, if the cost of the service is the responsibility of the examinee, the anticipated cost.\n\n\n6.03.01 Persons Not Ordered or Mandated to Undergo Examination\nIf the examinee is not ordered by the court to participate in a forensic examination, the forensic practitioner seeks his or her informed consent (EPPCC Standards 3.10, 9.03). If the examinee declines to proceed after being notified of the nature and purpose of the forensic examination, the forensic practitioner may consider postponing the examination, advising the examinee to contact his or her attorney, and notifying the retaining party about the examinee’s unwillingness to proceed.\n\n\n6.03.02 Persons Ordered or Mandated to Undergo Examination or Treatment\nIf the examinee is ordered by the court to participate, the forensic practitioner can conduct the examination over the objection, and without the consent, of the examinee (EPPCC Standards 3.10, 9.03). If the examinee declines to proceed after being notified of the nature and purpose of the forensic examination, the forensic practitioner may consider a variety of options including postponing the examination, advising the examinee to contact his or her attorney, and notifying the retaining party about the examinee’s unwillingness to proceed.\nWhen an individual is ordered to undergo treatment but the goals of treatment are determined by a legal authority rather than the individual receiving services, the forensic practitioner informs the service recipient of the nature and purpose of treatment, and any limitations on confidentiality and privilege (EPPCC Standards 3.10, 10.01).\n\n\n6.03.03 Persons Lacking Capacity to Provide Informed Consent\nForensic practitioners appreciate that the very conditions that precipitate psychological examination of individuals involved in legal proceedings can impair their functioning in a variety of important ways, including their ability to understand and consent to the evaluation process.\nFor examinees adjudicated or presumed by law to lack the capacity to provide informed consent for the anticipated forensic service, the forensic practitioner nevertheless provides an appropriate explanation, seeks the examinee’s assent, and obtain appropriate permission from a legally authorized person, as permitted or required by law (EPPCC Standards 3.10, 9.03).\nFor examinees whom the forensic practitioner has concluded lack capacity to provide informed consent to a proposed, non-court-ordered service, but who have not been adjudicated as lacking such capacity, the forensic practitioner strives to take reasonable steps to protect their rights and welfare (EPPCC Standard 3.10). In such cases, the forensic practitioner may consider suspending the proposed service or notifying the examinee’s attorney or the retaining party.\n\n\n6.03.04 Evaluation of Persons Not Represented by Counsel\nBecause of the significant rights that may be at issue in a legal proceeding, forensic practitioners carefully consider the appropriateness of conducting a forensic evaluation of an individual who is not represented by counsel. Forensic practitioners may consider conducting such evaluations or delaying the evaluation so as to provide the examinee with the opportunity to consult with counsel.\n\n\n6.04 Communication with Collateral Sources of Information\nForensic practitioners disclose to potential collateral sources information that might reasonably be expected to inform their decisions about participating that may include, but may not be limited to, who has retained the forensic practitioner; the nature, purpose, and intended use of the examination or other procedure; the nature of and any limits on privacy, confidentiality, and privilege; and whether their participation is voluntary (EPPCC Standard 3.10).\n\n\n6.05 Communication in Research Contexts\nWhen engaging in research or scholarly activities conducted as a service to a client in a legal proceeding, forensic practitioners attempt to clarify any anticipated use of the research or scholarly product, disclose their role in the resulting research or scholarly products, and obtain whatever consent or agreement is required.\nIn advance of any scientific study, forensic practitioners seek to negotiate with the client the circumstances under and manner in which the results may be made known to others. Forensic practitioners strive to balance the potentially competing rights and interests of the retaining party with the inappropriateness of suppressing data, for example, by agreeing to report the data without identifying the jurisdiction in which the study took place. Forensic practitioners represent the results of research in an accurate manner (EPPCC Standard 5.01)."

Practitioners are in a unique position to offer education, assessment, intervention, and advocacy on issues of REC disparities, racism, and discrimination in the field of psychology and the law. However, a limited body of research, lack of practice guidelines on REC integration in forensic practice, and low representation of Black, Indigenous, People Of Color (BIPOC) professionals, limit such efforts. Mentorship of emerging practitioners in psychology and the law on such issues can bridge the gap of knowledge, application, and BIPOC representation in the field.  \n \nThe AP-LS Practice Committee wants to recognize the substantive contributions of practitioner mentors who educate and support emerging clinicians in psychology and the law with a lens toward the elimination of REC disparities and social justice. For these purposes, we use Goldstein’s (2007) definition of the practice of psychology and the law: “The application of psychological research, theory, practice, and traditional and specialized methodology (e.g.  interviewing, psychological testing, forensic assessment, and forensically relevant instruments) to provide information relevant to a legal question.”  \n \nThe award for Outstanding Practitioner Mentoring to Eliminate Racial, Ethnic, and Cultural (REC) Disparities in the Field of Psychology and the Law, will be conferred on a yearly basis. The Recipient will receive a $500.00 cash award, a plaque to be presented at the annual AP-LS conference and will be featured in an AP-LS newsletter article, written by the practice committee, highlighting the recipient’s achievements and recommendations to other practitioners. Highlighting the recipient's mentorship practices and experiences can serve as a model for other professionals in the field of psychology and the law.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall for Nominations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Publications and Communications (P&C) Board of the American Psychological Association has opened nominations for the editorships of Clinician’s Research Digest, Psychology, Public Policy, and Law, Psychology and Aging, Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory and Cognition, and the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Interpersonal Relations and Group Processes.

As part of the BRIDGE Committee initiative to increase diversity within AP-LS, and the profession as a whole, these award programs support research for undergraduate and graduate students. Please take a few minutes to review the program descriptions below and consider if you or any students you know might be eligible, and encourage them to apply. Also, please feel free to forward this information to any colleagues who might be interested in these award programs. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15, 2022 through January 15, 2023. Recipients will be announced in February 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit Award Applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess Path to Psychology and Law Experience Program\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Access Path to Psychology and Law Experience (AP) Program is to increase diversity within psychology and law by increasing the pipeline of competitive graduate school applicants from groups that currently are underrepresented in the field, including racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and disabled students. AP is designed to encourage faculty members to recruit students from underrepresented groups into their research labs. It provides financial support for the students to obtain meaningful research experience and attend the AP-LS conference as well as other opportunities for mentoring and development. It is the intention of the BRIDGE Committee that many of the students in the AP program will apply for graduate training related to psychology and law and ultimately become professionals in the field. The AP program primarily targets undergraduate students, but students from terminal master’s degree programs will also be considered. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15, 2022 through January 15, 2023. Recipients will be announced in February 2023.\n\nFor more information about the AP Program, please contact the program Chair, Dr. Jason Lawrence at jason.lawrence@dmh.mo.gov.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit Award Applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAP-LS Diversity in Psychology and Law Research Awards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Diversity in Psychology and Law Research Awards is to promote diversity within the American Psychology-Law Society by supporting student research on psycholegal issues related to diversity as well as research by students from underrepresented groups. Projects are eligible for consideration for this award if (1) they investigate topics related to psychology, law, diversity, and/or multiculturalism (e.g., research pertaining to psycholegal issues on race, gender, culture, sexual orientation, etc.) or (2) if the principal investigator is a member of an underrepresented group, including racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and students with disabilities. Consistent with the mission of the BRIDGE Committee, these awards are intended to facilitate the research of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in AP-LS, as well as research about issues of potential interest and importance to such groups. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15th, 2022 through January15, 2023. Recipients will be announced in February 2023.\n\nFor more information about the Diversity Program, please contact the program Chair, Dr. Evelyn Maeder at evelyn.maeder@carlton.ca.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit Award Applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversity Travel Awards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of an initiative to increase diversity within AP-LS, the Minority Affairs Committee will provide travel awards to students from underrepresented groups (i.e., racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and students with disabilities) who are presenting research at the American Psychology-Law Society Conference. Seven competitive travel awards in the amount of $500 will be given. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15, 2022 through January 15, 2023.

It is important that you vote by December 15 to keep AP-LS's voice heard at APA.\n \nThe ballot includes votes on changes to the APA bylaws and an apportionment ballot which determines how many voting members AP-LS gets on APA's governing body, the Council of Representatives (Council). In the past year, your AP-LS representatives (Jason Cantone and Margaret Bull Kovera) have co-written legislation on the interrogation of criminal suspects, removal of felony status questions on psychological association applications, the creation of a Council ombuds, and removal of mental health treatment questions from bar exam character and fitness examinations, as well as legislation to improve the APA policymaking process. \n \nApportionment votes determine how many representatives AP-LS can send to APA Council. With more Council Representatives, we can better call attention to issues dear to our members and have a greater influence on APA policy. In the past few years, AP-LS has been very close to gaining a third representative! To get that third representative, we need each APA member to give all 10 of their apportionment votes to Division 41/AP-LS. Please make sure to vote! If you did not receive an e-mail ballot, please contact APA at elections@apa.org. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2022 Dissertation Award Competition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are accepting submissions for the 2022 Dissertation Award Competition.

Batastini, Ph.D. \nUniversity of Memphis \n \nJennifer Eno Louden, Ph.D. \nThe University of Texas at El Paso \n \nVirginia Barber-Rioja, Ph.D. \nCorrectional Health Services/NYC Health + Hospitals \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrectional institutions and departments are often slow-moving regarding practice developments, policy reform, and research engagement. Long-standing issues such as prison over-crowding, limited financial resources, geographical remoteness, low staff recruitment and retention, safety and security constraints, and traditional administrative values that favor punishment over rehabilitation can stifle the implementation of more innovative and progressive efforts. However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing calls from advocacy groups, politicians, and the general public have placed pressures on correctional systems to explore alternative solutions that balance crime  reduction with humane care and common sense policies. As jails and prisons continue to serve as major mental health providers, innovations specific to psychological interventions are especially relevant. \n \nThis special section will highlight emerging issues and inventive trends in correctional psychology research and practice that can inform policy decisions and reform efforts. Original quantitative and/or qualitative research is strongly encouraged; however, empirically grounded systematic  reviews or policy/practice recommendations will also be considered. Manuscripts focused on all areas of corrections are welcome, but topics of particular interest include: \n\nTechnological advances that improve access to and delivery of correctional practices or policy implementation\nIntegrating social justice principles in assessment and intervention for clients in correctional settings\nMental and behavioral health responses to COVID-19 in correctional settings o Creative approaches to addressing and reducing the jail-based competency crisis\nValidation of novel and feasible suicide and violence risk instruments with correctional samples\nMedication assisted treatment and other innovative substance use interventions\nAdaptation or development of evidence-based assessment or interventions for underserved  and understudied populations (e.g., people with neurodevelopmental disorders, women and  non-binary people, LGBTQIA+ persons, people of color, etc.)\nUnique methodological or statistical approaches to conducting correctional research or evaluating the effectiveness of new policies  \n\nFor general inquiries, prospective contributors may contact Dr. Ashley Batastini at Ashley.batastini@memphis.edu. Manuscripts must be submitted through the journal’s online submission portal in accordance with specified formatting guidelines. Once in the portal, there will be a drop-down option to designate your submission for consideration in this special section.  Deadline for submissions is March 15, 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLHB Reviewer Mentoring Program\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you always wondered how people get to be reviewers for prestigious journals? Are you interested in becoming a reviewer for Law and Human Behavior, the official journal of AP-LS, but don’t know what that means or how to get training and experience with providing strong reviews? Do you have limited or no access to a mentor that can help provide this type of experience?\n \nIf so, now is your chance to develop your reviewer skills! The LHB editorial team is continuing their Reviewer Mentoring Program in 2023. The program will kick off at the AP-LS Conference in Philadelphia with an in-person training and will continue throughout the rest of the year. The program is designed to provide advanced graduate students (in 3rd, 4th or 5th years of study) and ECPs (within 10 years of last terminal degree) with training and mentoring specifically in conducting strong peer reviews.\n \nWe will be selecting a small group of Reviewers to participate in the workshop in March 2023, and we will match those participants with Reviewer Mentors. Mentees will be assigned 1-2 manuscripts to review throughout 2023, under the guidance of their Reviewer Mentor.\n \nIf you would like to be considered for this program, please complete the application by December 31, 2022. If you have questions about the program, please contact our Associate Editor, Jenni Cox at jennifer.m.cox@ua.edu or Editor in Chief, Bradley McAuliff at bradley.mcauliff@csun.edu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply Today\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Announcement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Leah Georges has stepped down as Associate Editor of the newsletter.

    "text": "Welcome to the April 2021\n\n\nAmerican Psychology-Law Society (AP-LS) Newsletter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur monthly Newsletter provides information about activities, upcoming events, and resources to connect the psychology-law community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAP-LS aspires to excel as a valuable, effective, and influential organization advancing the science of psychology-law and the translation of psychology-law knowledge into practice and policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIN MEMORIAM\n\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that we inform the Division about the death of Dr. Steve Mandracchia on February 9, 2021. Dr. Mandracchia touched so many lives, directly and indirectly, throughout his 39-year career with the Missouri Department of Mental Health (DMH). He received his Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology from the University of Missouri—Columbia in 1982 and was hired as a psychologist with the DMH at the Center for Behavioral Medicine (CBM, formerly Western Missouri Mental Health Center) in Kansas City, Missouri.\nIn 1989, Dr. Mandracchia was appointed the Director of Forensic Services at CBM. In 1999, he started a forensic fellowship program at CBM. Dr. Mandracchia was never interested in promotions, first authorships, professional affiliations, awards, or accolades. He was interested in people. Because of Dr. Mandracchia, the Forensic Department he ran became a popular and storied training site for medical students, psychology interns, postdoctoral residents, and psychiatry fellows.\nDr. Mandracchia’s trainees are located throughout the nation. Heck, one trainee is even in Hong Kong. Many run distinguished forensic training programs. You’ll recognize Mandracchia trainees by their succinct reports, thoughtful phrasing, and the quoting of “Mandracchia-isms”—which often include using silly pronouns (e.g., Mr. Bahjahgahloop); abruptly announcing “gotta go, got a thing!”; and using the term “thing” for any item one cannot find/recall.\nThroughout his career, Dr. Mandracchia was a trailblazer. Before mental health courts, and when community behavioral health systems were in their infancy, Dr. Mandracchia cut through the red tape and helped people. He was instrumental in sparking a systemic change in our local Courts away from the nationally accepted practice of pretrial detention of persons accused of nonviolent offenses because they suffered from untreated mental illness and developmental disabilities. This inevitably led to institutionalized treatment. Dr. Mandracchia included in his reports the candid factual basis for nonviolent pretrial defendants and probationers to receive non-institutional treatment to attain competence and stability. But it was Dr. Mandracchia's clout and his development of an ad hoc forensic monitoring program and informal structural supports through CBM Forensic Department (shhhh) that made that first Judge willing to give community treatment a try…and it worked. Our Courts soon shifted away from automatic pretrial detention and institutional competency restoration for defendants accused of nonviolent offenses.\nDr. Mandracchia had a gift when it came to inquiries into a defendant's competence to proceed. He boiled down the essence and practicalities of the vaunted Dusky and Godinez opinions and made them relatable in rigidly concise evaluations and testimony that centered on a person's particular level of mental functioning. Always answering: How does this person think? Dr. Mandracchia had a straightforward but ingenious method of forensic interviewing. He always managed to pry loose relevant, highly credible, and distinctly quotable information. To wit, from two memorable restorees: “The Judge is like the DJ at a really good dance party who is in charge of playing just the right mix of tunes so everyone has a good time.” vs. \"I know where the bailiff sits!\"\nOne of Dr. Mandracchia's most valuable skills was his ability to quickly build genuine trust, and seemingly effortless rapport, with everyone within our local Court system. Steve really understood people and in return, people liked and trusted “Mandracchia”—from the accused (no matter their mental status) to jail guards, defense attorneys, prosecutors, probation officers, and judges. Despite his reputation as a convincing and unimpeachable witness, Dr. Mandracchia preferred and encouraged a collaborative approach to cases and consensus, using his institutional memory to avoid the pitfalls of the adversarial system. He was quick to remind all that where incompetency was concerned, justice required everyone to be on the same team. Dr. Mandracchia was just as convincing, perhaps even more so, over an adult beverage with lawyers as on the witness stand.\nDr. Mandracchia was a natural mentor. He was avuncular. He treated his colleagues as family. He allayed our fears of “getting it wrong” by saying, “What’s the worst that can happen? Just tell the truth.” He helped many of us establish private practices. He guided many of us through our own personal life crises by offering a listening ear, a kind heart. And always, there was a big hug.\nYou would never forget Dr. Mandracchia's compassion, wicked humor, infectious smile, and common-sense mantra (delivered in his native NY-ease): “If youse don't think too good, don't think too much.” Thanks to Steve Mandracchia, all of us who worked with him came to think measurably better.\nSteve is survived by his wife, Betty, his brother, Vinny (Denise), his five children: David, Rick (Kelly), Jon (Yen), Drew (Katie), and Laura (Jeff), as well as 12 grandchildren. He is also survived by countless friends, colleagues, former patients, and their families. His life was truly impactful. Those who were lucky enough to have had him in our lives are better people. We are all better personally and professionally. We miss this extraordinary man. In his humor, in friendship, and his intelligence, Steve Mandracchia can’t be replaced. Nobody will make our lives, our work, or our hearts feel as great as he did. Nobody will make us as sad as when we disappointed him. Nobody will make us laugh like we did with him.\nHe would disprove of this lengthy sentiment. That’s fine. That’s who he is. He would at least let us get away with this: Dr. Steve Mandracchia is fine.\nIn remembrance,\nGretchen Eikermann, J.D. & Lisa Witcher, Psy.D.\n\n\nLAW AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR SOCIAL MEDIA LAUNCH\nLaw and Human Behavior has partnered with the AP-LS Social Media and Student Committees and we are excited to announce the journal is launching into the social media stratosphere on April 1st.\nOur goal is to harness social media to share and discuss all of the excellent research in the journal. We'll highlight new publications in LHB every Tuesday, so please be sure to look for that post regularly. We have lots of other informative (and fun!) posts planned too, including author spotlights, highlights for open access articles, APA style updates, tips and tricks for publishing, and a peek 'behind the scenes' at LHB.\nFind us on Twitter (@lhb_apls), Instagram (@lawandhumanbehavior), and Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/lawandhumanbehavior)beginning April 1st!\n\n\nNEW COLUMN ANNOUNCEMENT: CLINICAL AND FORENSIC PRACTICE\nWe want our AP-LS newsletter to be relevant to and representative of all of our members. As a portion of our AP-LS membership primarily engages in practice as clinicians and evaluators, rather than primarily on research, policy development, or teaching, we are happy to introduce a new column, Clinical and Forensic Practice, aimed at practicing forensic psychologists. Do you have techniques on engaging patients in court-mandated treatment? Do you have important ideas about how to write more effective forensic evaluations? Are you anxious to share practical issues with researchers to inform future research projects? Are you facing specific challenges as a BIPOC psychologist? Or do you want to share how new policies and laws are affecting practitioners? Then this column is for you. Please reach out and share your ideas with column editor Danielle Rynczak, JD, PsyD, ABPP (Forensic), Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, and your new Clinical and Forensic Practice Editor, at danielle.rynczak@umassmed.edu.\n\n\nBOOK AWARDS\nThe AP-LS Book Awards Committee is pleased to announce that the winner of this year’s award is The Psychology of Family Law by Eve Brank. It was published by New York University Press in 2019. The work of the committee is concentrated over a few short months but requires intense reading and consideration. Some of the nominated titles were especially strong this year, and it is never easy to pick just one winner. The Book Awards Committee is honored to serve an important function by allowing at least one work by those in psychology and law to be recognized for their contributions to the field. Congratulations Dr. Brank!\n\n\nAP-LS ANNUAL VOLUNTEER DRIVE\nThe Executive Committee of AP-LS invites self-­nominations for service opportunities in committee membership, conference planning, and leadership. We welcome participation among all members and wish to represent in our governance the full diversity of our membership.\nCommittee terms are normally three years and all terms begin in August at the time of the APA Convention. Full committee terms of reference can be viewedhere.\nYou will be asked to fill out a form, upload your CV, and provide a short statement explaining why you are interested in serving on an AP-LS committee. From that information, the Governance Committee will work with the current Committee Chairs and the President to make committee appointments. Those appointments will occur by June so that members will have several weeks to prepare before their official terms begin in August. Orientations (online and through email) will occur during this time.\nPlease go to the following site and click on the \"Volunteer Drive\" tab:https://conferences.ap-ls.org/\n\n\nBOOK SERIES – NEW MISSION STATEMENT\nThrough its book series, the American Psychology-Law Society seeks to:\n\nAdvance and disseminate the science of psychology and law;\nAdvance the practice of psychology in legal contexts and establish contemporary best practices;\nPromote human rights, dignity, and justice in our multicultural, pluralistic society;\nActively encourage mentoring in the profession through knowledge dissemination and the publication process.\n\nThe Book Series Editorial Team invites proposals from authors and editors across the broad spectrum of Psychology and Law, both science and practice. The Team is particularly interested in proposals for authored and edited volumes from:\n\nTraditionally under-represented authors and editors;\nCollaborating psychologists and lawyers/legal scholars;\nCollaborating veteran and early-career scientists and/or practitioners.\n\nThe Editorial Team hopes its published volumes will cover chronic disenfranchisement in the U.S. and beyond, and anti-racist science and practice that corrects for the ongoing effects of racism and discrimination. The Team recognizes that some authors/editors will possess the knowledge and expertise to achieve this objective, whereas others may be less experienced at addressing these important topics. The Team is poised to assist and support authors and editors in meeting this and other publication objectives.\n\n\nCALL FOR PAPERS: SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESS AND EFFECTS ON THE LAW\nIn collaboration with the journalFrontiers in Psychology, we are bringing together a group of international scholars to contribute to an open-access article collection on \"Social Psychological Process and Effects on the Law.\"We welcome empirical, review and theoretical submissions across disciplines, including but not limited to psychology, sociology, criminology, anthropology, and law, from any country or jurisdiction.

With respect to updates about the legal side of the psychology and law interface, the websites of the American Psychology–Law Society may currently be a far cry from the dynamism of a website like SCOTUSblog. However, AP-LS’s social media presence is a step in that direction.\n \nThus, it occurred to us, for the first author’s last column as editor of the Legal Update column of AP-LS News, to submit an entry that might serve as another step—albeit a humble one—in the direction of imitating some of the impressive offerings from SCOTUSblog, but specific to psychology and law. And so, rather than focusing on SCOTUS, we thought to focus on the amicus curiae briefs (amicus briefs, for short) of AP-LS’s parent organization, the American Psychological Association.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the Full Legal Update Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPA Updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe APA Committee on Early Career Psychologists seeks nominees for three Early Career Psychologist (ECP) Achievement Awards.

It is important to recognize early-career professionals as there is often a myriad of novel challenges and concerns that they are required to navigate. Many of these concerns are often introduced after their graduate studies are completed. These challenges may include obtaining licensure, establishing private practices, and seeking continuing education credits. The ECP would like to further the mission of AP-LS to increase research, education, and training around diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n \nDo you identify as an early-career professional (someone with less than 10 years since graduating) and currently practicing primarily as a practitioner?

We have been in contact with APA and received guidance about their longstanding standards required to provide CEs. We plan to use this information—and their offers of ongoing consultation—as we try to build the organizational infrastructure to be able to provide CEs at future conferences. In this vein, we have begun collaborating with SBI, the new Association Management Company of AP-LS. We hope to have this framework implemented by the time the call for proposals goes out this fall. We appreciate everyone who shared their thoughts about this matter.

It is important to recognize early career professionals as there are often a myriad of novel challenges and concerns that they are required to navigate. Many of these concerns are often introduced after their graduate studies are completed. These challenges may include obtaining licensure, establishing private practices, and seeking continued education credits. The ECP would like to further the mission of AP-LS to increase research, education, and training around diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n \nAre you a professional who identifies as early career (per APA less than seven years since graduating) and currently practicing primarily as a practitioner? You may qualify for the ECP Practitioner Grant.\n \nTo apply, send a cover letter that includes:  \n\nFirst and last name\nYear last degree obtained\nEmail address\nTelephone number\nMailing address\nA letter of intent (1,500 word maximum) that describes \n- Your current professional role(s) and connection to the field of psychology and law\n- How you intend to use the grant\n- How receiving the grant will enhance your practice and career growth\n- How receiving the grant will further the practice of psychology and law\n- How receiving the grant will contribute to broader impacts to society and the broader mission of AP-LS to increase efforts in diversity, equity, and inclusion.\nUpdated CV\n\nDeadline: August 15.

A Primer on Overdose Prevention Centers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAficionados of The Wire may fondly remember a key third-season storyline in which Major Howard “Bunny” Colvin—commander of the Baltimore Police Department’s Western District—created “free zones” in which substances could be sold and used without police interference as long as violence and homicide remained at bay (Simon & Kostroff Noble, 2002-2006). Crime rates dropped precipitously, the use and selling of substances were kept out of the public eye, and community morale improved. However—and perhaps most importantly—substance use was viewed not solely as a public safety problem, but also as a public health problem. Unfortunately, when news of the so-called “Hamsterdam”—and concerns that West Baltimore had “legalized” drugs—reached high-level police and political command, Major Colvin’s initiative was quickly shut down.\n \nThis Legal Update column seeks to:\n(1) overview harm reduction, the set of principles and strategies underlying OPCs;\n(2) outline OPCs and the evidence behind them;\n(3) chronicle the social and legal impediments towards the broader expansion of OPCs; and\n(4) discuss potential legal, clinical, and forensic implications of OPCs.\n \nRead the full column &gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2023 Saleem Shah Award: Call for Nominations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Saleem Shah Award is an annual award co-sponsored by the American Academy of Forensic Psychology and the American Psychology-Law Society recognizing early career excellence and exceptional contributions to the field of psychology and law. The focus of a nominee’s contributions may be in any area of forensic psychology practice, research or public policy. The recipient must have received their doctoral degree (or law degree, whichever comes later, if both were earned) within the last six years; year 2016 or later, inclusive of 2016. The award includes $2,000 as well as the opportunity to give the Saleem Shah Address at the next meeting of the American Psychology-Law Society. \n \nNominations are due by Midnight EST on November 30, 2022, and must include each of the following:\n\nA letter detailing the nominee’s contributions to psychology and law\nA copy of the nominee’s vita.

Also, please feel free to forward this information to any colleagues who might be interested in these award programs. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15, 2022 through January 15, 2023. Recipients will be announced in February 2023.\n\nSubmit Your Application for these Awards \n \nAccess Path to Psychology and Law Experience Program\nThe purpose of the Access Path to Psychology and Law Experience (AP) Program is to increase diversity within psychology and law by increasing the pipeline of competitive graduate school applicants from groups that currently are underrepresented in the field, including racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and disabled students. AP is designed to encourage faculty members to recruit students from underrepresented groups into their research labs. It provides financial support for the students to obtain meaningful research experience and attend the AP-LS conference as well as other opportunities for mentoring and development. It is the intention of the BRIDGE Committee that many of the students in the AP program will apply for graduate training related to psychology and law and ultimately become professionals in the field. The AP program primarily targets undergraduate students, but students from terminal master’s degree programs will also be considered. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15, 2022 through January 15, 2023. Recipients will be announced in February 2023.\n\nFor more information about the AP Program, please contact the program Chair, Dr. Jason Lawrence at jason.lawrence@dmh.mo.gov.\n\nAP-LS Diversity in Psychology and Law Research Awards\nThe purpose of the Diversity in Psychology and Law Research Awards is to promote diversity within the American Psychology-Law Society by supporting student research on psycholegal issues related to diversity as well as research by students from underrepresented groups. Projects are eligible for consideration for this award if (1) they investigate topics related to psychology, law, diversity, and/or multiculturalism (e.g., research pertaining to psycholegal issues on race, gender, culture, sexual orientation, etc.) or (2) if the principal investigator is a member of an underrepresented group, including racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and students with disabilities. Consistent with the mission of the BRIDGE Committee, these awards are intended to facilitate the research of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in AP-LS, as well as research about issues of potential interest and importance to such groups. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15, 2022 through January 15, 2023. Recipients will be announced in February 2023.\n\nFor more information about the Diversity Program, please contact the program Chair, Dr. Evelyn Maeder at evelyn.maeder@carlton.ca.\n\nDiversity Travel Awards\nAs part of an initiative to increase diversity within AP-LS, the Minority Affairs Committee will provide travel awards to students from underrepresented groups (i.e., racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and students with disabilities) who are presenting research at the American Psychology-Law Society Conference. Seven competitive travel awards in the amount of $500 will be given. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15, 2022 through January 15, 2023. Recipients will be announced in February 2023.\n\nFor more information about the Diversity Travel Award program, please contact the program Chair, Dr. Amanda NeMoyer at ann38@drexel.edu.\n \nSubmit Your Application for these Awards \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPA Updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn September 15, APA sent members an email ballot for the APA President-Elect and APA Board of Directors elections. This year, the AP-LS Executive Committee asked each APA President-Elect candidate three questions about issues relevant to AP-LS. Please refer to the August AP-LS newsletter for those questions and responses so you can make an informed decision. If you are an APA member and did not receive a ballot, contact APA at elections@apa.org.\n \nThe APA Board of Educational Affairs is requesting comments on two documents relevant to undergraduate psychology education. The first document, APA Guidelines for the Undergraduate Psychology Major: Version 3.0 is currently in its second round of review. Comments are due October 26. More information is located on their website.  \n \nAPA also seeks comment on the APA Principles for Quality Undergraduate Education in Psychology. As stated by APA, \"Whereas Guidelines 3.0 describe a set of curricular goals, student learning outcomes, and foundation and baccalaureate indicators of learning progress, the Quality Principles define the actions that faculty members, programs, and departments can take, and the ongoing practices they can adopt, to create a high-quality, stimulating, and inclusive learning environment designed to maximize student learning and professional development.\" Comments on this second document are due October 18.

Are you interested in becoming a reviewer for Law and Human Behavior, the official journal of AP-LS, but don’t know what that means or how to get training and experience with providing strong reviews? Do you have limited or no access to a mentor that can help provide this type of experience? If so, now is your chance to develop your reviewer skills!\n \nThe LHB editorial team is continuing its Reviewer Mentoring Program in 2023. The program will kick off at the AP-LS Conference in Philadelphia with an in-person training and will continue throughout the rest of the year. The program is designed to provide advanced graduate students (in 3rd, 4thor 5th years of study) and ECPs (within 10 years of last terminal degree) with training and mentoring specifically in conducting strong peer reviews. We will be selecting a small group of reviewers to participate in the workshop in March 2023, and we will match those participants with Reviewer Mentors. Mentees will be assigned 1-2 manuscripts to review throughout 2023, under the guidance of their Reviewer Mentor. If you would like to be considered for this program, please complete the application by December 31, 2022.\n \nApply Now to Be a Reviewer\n \nIf you have questions about the program, please contact our Associate Editor, Jenni Cox at jennifer.m.cox@ua.edu or Editor in Chief, Bradley McAuliff at bradley.mcauliff@csun.edu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply to become a Fellow or Distinguished Member of AP-LS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to our bylaws, “Full Members nominated for Fellow in the Society must provide evidence of unusual and outstanding contributions in the area of psychology and law. All candidates for Fellow must be endorsed by at least two Fellows of the Society. In addition, all candidates for Fellow must meet the requirements of the bylaws of the Association. Full Affiliates nominated for Distinguished Member in the Society must provide evidence of unusual and outstanding contributions in the area of psychology and law. All candidates for Distinguished Member must be endorsed by at least two Fellows or Distinguished Members of the Society.” \n \nMembers nominated for Fellow or Distinguished member status through AP-LS must provide evidence of unusual and outstanding contributions in the area of psychology and law. The deadline for receipt of all application materials (nominee’s materials and endorsers’ materials) is 1 December. For Fellow status (unless you are already a Fellow in another division), apply through the APA Fellow Portal. For Distinguished Member status and if you are already a Fellow in another APA division, email materials to ebrank2@unl.edu.

This is a momentous and exciting step forward for our program’s efforts to address systemic racism, in line with several recent APA resolutions. Both fellowships will begin on 1 January 2023 and will involve an honoraria stipends of $1,000 USD.  \n  \nThese fellowships are designed specifically to elevate opportunities for ECPs from historically excluded groups (particularly Black, Indigenous, and other people of color, as well as members from other communities which have been historically excluded from leadership opportunities in research and publishing). \n \nThe fellowships are open to qualified candidates who have completed their education/training and are no more than 10 years postdoctoral, including current members of the journal’s editorial board. Candidates would typically hold a position at the rank of assistant professor (or equivalent, such as a research scientist), although individuals in non-academic positions and suitable qualifications are also eligible. The fellowships will last one year, and fellows will receive a stipend of $1,000 for the year.\n \nQualified candidates should have experience conducting peer reviews, and expertise in topics of cultural and ethnic diversity is desirable. We also look for evidence of a broad perspective, good judgment, exceptional communication skills, and strong management skills, as well as a commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion.\n \nThe fellows will work closely with the journal’s Editor, Michael E. Lamb, or one of the associate editors, Nancy Steblay and Tess Neal, to develop their editorial skills. Each fellow will manage approximately 6 to 12 manuscripts over the course of the year. This process will include screening manuscripts for appropriateness, identifying reviewers, making an editorial decision based on reviews, and shepherding the manuscript through to publication if accepted, all with mentorship from the editor or associate editor. The successful candidate will also be expected to participate in monthly meetings with their mentor to ensure goals are met. Most of these meetings will be video teleconferences, although in-person meetings at scientific conferences are also possible. Upon successful completion of the fellowship, Editorial fellows will become members of the journal’s editorial board if they are not already.\n \nPlease encourage interested and qualified candidates to send an application to mel37@cam.ac.uk by October 31, 2022. They should include a cover letter introducing themselves, their expertise, and an explanation of why they would be appropriate candidates as well as a copy of their CV. Appointments will be made in the fall and the positions will begin at the start of 2023. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall for Grant Proposals: Research to Enhance the Impact and Diversification of Psychology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe American Psychology-Law Society (AP-LS) invites research proposals for Research to Enhance the Impact and Diversification of Psychology & Law Research. The intent of this grant initiative is to advance a more interdisciplinary science that addresses understudied topics in psychology and law, as well as to broaden the discipline and amplify its practical impact. Proposed projects must investigate new or understudied topics in psychology and law, enhance the diversification of psychology and law research through novel theoretical or methodological approaches that are cross-disciplinary in nature, and/or promote the impact of research by considering novel populations or new problems or processes within the legal system; the proposed project is to include collaboration with practitioners or policymakers. \n \nPre-proposal submissions will open on October 4 and the deadline is October 15, 2022. Selected pre-proposal submissions will be notified in November if they are selected to submit a full proposal and full proposals will be due in mid-December.\n \nPre-proposals can be submitted at awards.ap-ls.org.

Besides the traditional format comprising a series of exceptional keynotes, workshops, open papers/symposia, and poster sessions, we aim to boost the interactivity and networking opportunities offered by the EAPL, while introducing new presentation types (blitz talks, expert focus sessions, and keynote outstanding questions).\n\nImportant dates\nSubmission deadline: April 24, 2023\nNotifications of acceptance will be offered on a rolling basis until May 15, 2023, at the latest.\n\nMain Themes\n\nEyewitness identification & memory\nInterviews, interrogations & confessions\nDeception detection & malingering\nCredibility assessment\nForensic & risk assessment\nDecision-making\nCriminal investigations\nVictims & offenders\n\nTypes of Submissions\n \nOral Presentation\nOral presentation sessions provide the opportunity for an extended presentation of your research, followed by a discussion with participants within dedicated parallel sessions which will be grouped by the organizers.\n \nPoster Presentation\nThe poster session will be a unique opportunity for an extended discussion of your research, potentially with all conference participants.\n \nBlitz-Talk\nBlitz-Talks are concise individual contributions. Each presenter will have five minutes to present and two minutes for questions. Blitz-Talks can report all types of research, but this submission type is especially suitable for presenting single studies on novel topics, new data for discussion, replication studies, null findings, and multi-study papers using a well-known methodology.\nSymposium\nTo encourage interaction between EAPL members on specific common topics of interest, we are welcoming oral symposia. A symposium chair (or two co-chairs) invites three to five colleagues, ideally belonging to different research groups to participate.\n\nFor more details regarding submissions, visit the website.

Authors and editors should have a substantial and recent track record of publication and/or practice in psychology or law, and at least one should hold a doctorate in psychology or closely related behavioral science. If you have a proposal for a new book in the series or you would simply like more information, reach out to a member of the editorial team.

For Senator Hunt, the proposed ban was personal: her son had recently come out as transgender. “This is my life and this is my reality, and all of you know me . . . When my son came out to me, the challenges that I felt emotionally around that were private . . . but I was so happy to learn that I had a son.”\n \nThough Senator Hunt and her family will be intimately affected if Nebraska passes the proposed legislation, state policies and bans on gender-affirming care for transgender and gender diverse youth will have broader impacts. This Legal Update will describe current state policies addressing gender-affirming care for youth and the legal challenges to these policies. The Legal Update will also briefly summarize research and professional organizations’ position statements regarding these policies, before exploring how these policies will affect psychologists.\n \nRead the column.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall for Papers: Special Issue on Bias in the Justice and Legal Systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBias is a pervasive aspect of human thought and behavior that influences how we perceive, interpret, and respond to the world around us. Individual biases, which may be implicit or explicit, also contribute to structural biases in the systems we create. Bias is a problem in the justice and legal systems because they are built upon assumptions of fairness and equality.\n \nSocial scientists who study the justice and legal systems can contribute greatly to our understanding of bias and its underlying mechanisms, consequences, and potential interventions. It is critical for social scientists to address these issues and to disseminate our knowledge in an accessible manner.\n \nTo this end, Law and Human Behavior seeks submissions for an upcoming special issue on \"Bias in the Justice and Legal Systems,\" edited by Lucy Guarnera, Jennifer Perillo, and Kyle Scherr. We define bias as the influence of irrelevant factors (or the misapplication of relevant factors) to create systematic deviations in how people solve problems, make decisions, or form judgments. \n \nWe are soliciting submissions that examine the influence of \"Bias in the Justice and Legal Systems\" including, but not limited, to:\n\nAttorneys (charges, disclosure, plea bargains, jury selection)\nCivil (child custody, personal injury)\nEducation (school discipline, Title IX)\nForensic experts (selection of cases, assessment of evidence, formation of opinions, task relevance)\nImmigration (legal status, deportation)\nIncarceration and other legal sanctions (risk assessment, mental health, infractions)\nJudges (excluding/limiting expert testimony, rulings, sentencing)\nJuries (credibility assessments, deliberation, verdicts)\nLaw enforcement (stops, arrest, use of force, interrogations)\nMilitary (courts martial, intelligence interviewing, information gathering)\nPretrial (detention, bail, access to quality legal representation)\nReentry & community corrections (probation, employment, housing, education)\nWrongful conviction, exoneration, & confession\n\nBecause these systems consist of multiple decision-points, with the potential for one judgment to influence others, we will give particular preference to papers that examine the accumulation of bias at multiple decision-points within and across systems. Cumulative disadvantage and similar frameworks may be relevant here. We also encourage submissions investigating bias related to individual identities (e.g., race, ethnicity, sexual or gender identities, immigration status), as well as structural biases inherent in conflict resolution and adversarial processes (e.g., accessibility, availability of resources). \n \nWe welcome submissions that use quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods to address theoretical, methodological, and practice issues involving bias. To maximize the potential impact of this Special Issue, we ask authors to write in a manner that is accessible to readers outside their discipline, including lay readers. In addition, every submission must contain a section that explicitly addresses the practical and policy implications of the work.\n \nAuthors interested in contributing a manuscript for the Special Issue should submit a nonbinding letter of intent by July 15, 2023. This letter should include (1) tentative title, (2) brief description of the manuscript in 500 words or less, and (3) all authors and affiliations. Please email letters of intent to LHB.bias@gmail.com.  \n \nAuthors who submit letters of intent will be notified if they are invited to submit a full manuscript for consideration. The deadline to submit a manuscript is November 1, 2023. Authors should refer to the Submission Guidelines on the Law and Human Behavior website and prepare their manuscripts in accordance with the Seventh Edition of the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association. Authors should submit electronically using the Editorial Manager web portal and specify in their cover letters that they would like their submissions to be considered for the Special Issue on Bias in the Justice and Legal Systems.\n \nQuestions about the Special Issue or the potential appropriateness of particular submissions can be sent to LHB.bias@gmail.com or directed to the editors, Lucy Guarnera (lag8e@virginia.edu), Jen Perillo (JTPerillo@salud.unm.edu), or Kyle Scherr (scher1kc@cmich.edu). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall for Undergraduate Paper Award\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEligibility\nTo be eligible for an award, the student must be the major contributor to a project on a topic relevant to psychology and law (i.e., the student had primary responsibility for initiating and conducting the project even though the project will usually be conducted under the supervision of a mentor). Data collection should be complete. Winners will be encouraged to submit their work for presentation at the AP-LS Conference (as first authors). Students may submit their work during their first post-undergraduate year as long as the work was conducted during their undergraduate career.\n \nHow to Apply\nSubmit one copy of APA-style paper (Abstract required). The paper should be a maximum of 25 pages of text (12-point font, one-inch margins), including the Abstract and Tables/Figures. The 25-page maximum does not include the Title Page and References. Papers that do not meet these requirements will be disqualified. \n \nEach applicant must have their mentor submit a letter of support to the chair that characterizes the nature and extent of the student’s contribution to the project. This letter should be a maximum of two pages of text (12-point font, one-inch margins). Applications that do not meet these requirements for letters of support will be disqualified.\n \nDeadline for receipt of all materials is June 30. The paper and mentor letter should be emailed to Dr. Emily Pica at undergrad_paper@ap-ls.org. \n \nSubmissions from students whose mentors are serving on this committee are welcome, but those mentors will not review the papers.\n \nSee our website for additional details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCareer Corner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Career Corner is intended to highlight the individuals who work at the intersection of law and psychology, where they come from, how they got there, and how their experiences influence their research, teaching, and/or practice. This edition of the Career Corner profiles Dr. Angela van der Walt, Bureau of Prisons- Psychological Evaluations Section. Dr. van der Walt has research interests in forensic evaluation, violence risk assessment, severe mental illness, and policy development. Laura Stevens, a final year Psychology PhD student at the University of Birmingham and 2022-2023 Student Committee Experimental Liaison, interviewed Dr. van der Walt.\n \nRead this Column\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPA Updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe APA Science Student Council (SSC) seeks new members for the September 2023 - September 2025 term.

So let’s start with the basics: our association is stronger than ever. We have an incredibly active membership at every level of training – from undergraduates to well-established professionals. Our journals (both our official journal, LHB, and our unofficial second journal, PPPL) have never been more impactful. Our upcoming conference has an impressive set of plenary presentations, symposia, and most importantly, ample opportunities for connecting. And the early numbers on conference registration point to a very strong turnout. In other words, AP-LS is running smoothly. Admittedly, we’ve been having some adjustment challenges to the loss of our long-time administrator (Kathy Gaskey) and the switch to a professional management company, but those adjustments are being worked out, and shouldn’t be noticeable to the vast majority of members. And when the dust settles on this transition, we’ll be stronger and better organized than ever. Which brings me to the question of what sort of “presidential initiative” I should be working on.\n\nMy predecessors have developed and carried out many impressive and thoughtful initiatives, such as efforts to increase the diversity of our membership (e.g., through developing and nurturing our impressive BRIDGE Committee and the many activities they sponsor), increasing the representation of attorneys in our membership (i.e., growing the L in AP-LS), impacting the communities we visit, and expanding the “inner circle” of the organization leadership by bringing in new faces to serve on committees and task forces. There have also been many efforts behind the scenes that have not necessarily stemmed from any specific Presidential Initiatives. Nonetheless, in recent years we’ve taken many steps to increase the resources we make available to both students and members (e.g., increasing our funding for student support grants, developing the ECP and REID grants), ease the transition from student to early career professional, make conference attendance more accessible for new parents and those with physical impediments, and to expand the services (and attention) we provide for our many members who work in applied settings. The latter development has become increasingly important, and one that is personally important to me as someone who divides their time (and interests) between academia and applied practice. One visible example of this increased attention to practitioners is the addition of CE credits for a large portion of the conference programming – included in the cost of registration (not just for pre-conference workshops, which we have always offered and continue to provide this year). For a number of logistical reasons we can’t provide CE credits for every paper presentation, but we are providing CE credits for virtually all symposia, invited addresses and plenary sessions so attendees should be able to get as many as 15 CE credits over the 2.5 conference days simply by attending talks that they may have attended anyway. Why are we doing this? To encourage our applied members to attend the annual meeting and keep their connection with the organization, and to see that the organization serves us all, not just the researchers who apply for the grants and get most of the awards. \n\nSo, what should our next steps be? I think the answer is growth. Not in membership numbers, though that might happen too, but in our scope and impact. In truth, this has been a personal mission of mine for most of my career, in part because many of my own interests haven’t always fit squarely into the mainstream topics that fill most of our journal pages and conference presentations. My early research focused on capacity to make treatment decisions and evolved into studying physician-assisted suicide. More recently, I’ve been involved in work surrounding immigration court, both in a clinical capacity (conducting asylum evaluations) and research (studying asylum-relevant issues in undocumented migrants). So not surprisingly, this is where I see the opportunities for growth in our association: bringing our skills as researchers and clinicians to legal issues that have traditionally garnered relatively little attention. Some examples? Immigration law is an easy starting point. How often are psychological evaluations used in asylum or deportation proceedings?  Are they helpful in increasing fairness of these proceedings, or impacting outcomes more generally (since “fairness” is an inherently challenging metric)? Are there better or worse approaches to conducting these types of evaluations? Is telephonic/video testimony (which has always been more common in Immigration court, even before the pandemic) less impactful? How do Immigration Court judges view expert testimony? These same questions could be applied to a range of other topics, including child custody evaluations, personal injury evaluations, and the capacity to make treatment or financial decisions (or guardianship more broadly). They are common legal issues that have a central role for psychology but are virtually absent from our journals and conferences, yet represent a large portion of the work that many forensic clinical psychologists engage in. And while these “clinical” examples are the ones that come first to mind (I am a clinician, after all), equally important novel and/or understudied questions exist for our non-clinical researchers. I’ll talk more about this in my Presidential Address, but in the meantime I would encourage you all – especially our younger members who are trying to carve out a niche for themselves in what might sometimes feel like a crowded field, to think about how you can expand your own personal range, whether that’s in research, consultation or clinical activities.\n \nSo there it is – a preview of my Presidential Initiative and a quick snapshot of our organization’s overall health. We’ve bounced back from the challenges of the pandemic and are at full strength. I hope to catch up with many of you at the annual meeting in Philadelphia next month, and for those of you I don’t know, please feel free to introduce yourself. I’m always happy to meet new people and make new friends. \n\nBarry Rosenfeld, Ph.D., A.B.P.P. (Forensic)\nPresident, American Psychology-Law Society\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPsychology, Public Policy, and Law \nCall for Papers on Emerging Issues in Correctional Policy, Research, and Practice\n*Extended Deadline*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuest Editors:  \nAshley B. Batastini, Ph.D. \nUniversity of Memphis \n \nJennifer Eno Louden, Ph.D. \nThe University of Texas at El Paso \n \nVirginia Barber-Rioja, Ph.D. \nCorrectional Health Services/NYC Health + Hospitals \n \nCorrectional institutions and departments are often slow-moving regarding practice developments, policy reform, and research engagement. Long-standing issues such as prison over-crowding, limited financial resources, geographical remoteness, low staff recruitment and retention, safety and  security constraints, and traditional administrative values that favor punishment over rehabilitation can stifle the implementation of more innovative and progressive efforts.\n \nHowever, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing calls from advocacy groups, politicians, and the general public have placed pressures on correctional systems to explore alternative solutions that balance crime reduction with humane care and commonsense policies. As jails and prisons continue to serve as major mental health providers, innovations specific to psychological interventions are especially relevant. \n \nThis special section will highlight emerging issues and inventive trends in correctional psychology research and practice that can inform policy decisions and reform efforts. Original quantitative and/or qualitative research is strongly encouraged; however, empirically grounded systematic reviews or policy/practice recommendations will also be considered. Manuscripts focused on all areas of corrections are welcome, but topics of particular interest include: \n\nTechnological advances that improve access to and delivery of correctional practices or policy implementation\nIntegrating social justice principles in assessment and intervention for clients in correctional settings\nMental and behavioral health responses to COVID-19 in correctional settings\nCreative approaches to addressing and reducing the jail-based competency crisis\nValidation of novel and feasible suicide and violence risk instruments with correctional samples\nMedication-assisted treatment and other innovative substance use interventions\nAdaptation or development of evidence-based assessment or interventions for underserved and understudied populations (e.g., people with neurodevelopmental disorders, women and non-binary people, LGBTQIA+ persons, people of color, etc.)\nUnique methodological or statistical approaches to conducting correctional research or evaluating the effectiveness of new policies  \n\nFor general inquiries, prospective contributors may contact Dr. Ashley Batastini (Ashley.batastini@memphis.edu).\n \nManuscripts must be submitted through the journal’s online submission portal in accordance with specified formatting guidelines. Once in the portal, there will be a drop-down option to designate your submission for consideration in this special section. The deadline for submissions is March 15, 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPA Update: APA Council Meeting February 23-25, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCouncil approved the consent agenda, which included adoption of the APA Principles for Quality Undergraduate Education in Psychology and the extension of the Specialty Guidelines in Forensic Psychology. The extension of the specialty guidelines is especially relevant for many of our members and will allow for the APA Ethics Committee to finish its work revising the APA Ethics Code before the specialty guidelines expire, as the revised code could inform revisions to the specialty guidelines. \n \nCouncil members remembered APA members who died since we last met. Your Council representatives along with a representative from Division 42 rose to remember Kento Yasuhara.\n \nThe proposal for a new Committee for the Advancement of General Applied Psychology passed, with 91.1% of the Council voting to establish committee. This new group will provide a home within APA for activities designed to advance applied psychological science and research outside of the direct delivery of mental health services. The committee will provide new opportunities for APLS members to get involved in APA. As the Chair of the Caucus on General Applied Psychology and Psychologists, your representative Margaret Bull Kovera worked with the movers of this proposal to educate other Council members on the unaddressed needs that could be addressed by creating this new governance structure within APA. Close to 95% of Council voted to support the new applied general psychology committee's request to perform an annual self-assessment and establish liaison relationships across APA governance. \n \nCouncil discussed and voted on a resolution on Confidentiality and Reproductive Health, which was approved with a vote of 96.7% in favor. The resolution emphasizes the importance of confidentiality within the psychology profession and addresses when psychologists are faced with ethical conflicts with law.\n \nCouncil overwhelmingly (97%) voted to approve a report on an offer of apology to First Peoples in the United States.\n \n97% of Council voted to approve educational guidelines for equitable and respectful treatment of students in graduate psychology training programs. \n \nCouncil voted on whether to create an exception to Keesey’s procedures so that new business items can be added to Council agenda with a 50%+1 vote rather than a 2/3 vote in favor, when any objections had been raised to adding the item.  This proposal was rejected by 70% of Council after extensive discussion.  \n \nIt is now possible for new business items to be discussed at the plenary meeting prior to the official start of Council business – 67.1% of Council voted in favor of this new practice. \n \nThere was a discussion about a motion to remove the requirement for the Council Leadership Team (CLT), and Boards and committees that have reviewed a new business item to provide an opinion on the item before it is considered in final form. After some discussion, 57% of Council voted to postpone a vote on this motion until the August meeting when the Council will receive a report on an evaluation of the effectiveness of the CLT. \n \n96.1% of Council voted to approve a change to the association rules so that all members of the Board of Directors (BoD) will be subject to the same review prior to being slated for election to a BoD seat as had previously been applied only to candidates for members-at-large seat. Your representatives successfully lobbied in advance of the Council meeting to have a felony status question removed from the review process.  \n \n88% of Council voted to postpone discussion of changes to simultaneous services election-related rules until its next meeting in August. \n \nThen, 66% of Council voted to create a three-year Council liaison pilot program between Council and selected APA Boards/Committees. \n \nCouncil then had a thoughtful discussion about the APA Strategic Plan and how APA, guided by psychological science, can address important societal issues in the next 3-5 years. \n \nCouncil approved Resolution on Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in Quality Continuing Education and Professional Development, with 93.3% voting in favor of the resolution. \n \nCouncil (93.7%) postponed until August a vote on a new procedure for improving the diversity impact statement statements that accompany new business items to give the movers more time to refine motion. Jason Cantone has volunteered to assist the movers in this revision process.  \n \nAs always, if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to either of your APA Council Representatives.  \n \nRespectfully submitted,\n \nMargaret Bull Kovera (on behalf of herself and Jason Cantone)\nPlaceholder for more text coming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAP-LS 2023 Conference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAP-LS is just a few weeks away! We look forward to seeing everyone in Philadelphia, PA. \n\nThe full program for AP-LS 2023 is now posted on the AP-LS website.\n\nAlso, moving forward, please note that the Conference Co-Chairs Miko Wilford and Andrea Avila are responsible for conference programming and can be contacted at conference@ap-ls.org.\n \nThe AP-LS Office handles all other conference-related queries pertaining to, for instance, the Speaker Agreement forms, continuing education (CE) requirements, satellite or social events, etc. They can be contacted at office@ap-ls.org.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Conference Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterested in learning more about becoming a Fellow or Distinguished Member of AP-LS?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you would like to learn more about becoming a Division 41 APA Fellow or Distinguished Member of AP-LS, then please plan on attending the Fellows meet-and-greet at the AP-LS Conference in Philadelphia.\n \nStop by the hospitality suite anytime between 4:30 and 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, March 18, 2023. Please ask at the registration desk for the hospitality suite room number, as it is yet to be assigned. \n \nVisit our website for more information about criteria for becoming a Fellow. \n \nQuestions or other inquiries can be directed to the current chair of the AP-LS Fellows Committee, Eve Brank at ebrank2@unl.edu. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Law and Science Dissertation Grant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, Arizona State University launched a new Law and Science Dissertation Grant (LSDG) program, funded through the National Science Foundation (SBE #2016661). This competitive program replaces NSF’s successful and longstanding Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant (DDRIG) program in Law and Science. The award to ASU provides funding of up to $20,000 apiece to doctoral students in diverse law-and-science disciplines (e.g., anthropology, criminal justice, economics, forensic science, political science, psychology, sociology) to conduct their dissertation research.\n \nThe next submission deadline is May 15, 2023, at 11:59 p.m. MST. Annual deadlines will be on May 15 and November 15 (or the first business day thereafter if the date falls on a weekend or federal holiday). Please spread the word to any students who might be interested in funding their dissertation research through this grant.\n\nFor more information about the LSDG program, please visit (and share) our website.\n\nIf you have any questions pertaining to the LSDG program, you may complete the ‘Contact Us’ form included on the website.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall for Book Proposals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe American Psychology-Law Society invites proposals for new titles in its book series, which is now published by APA Books. We publish authored and edited volumes on current issues at the intersection of psychology and law. Books are typically a state-of-the-science synthesis of a body of existing research with implications for practice and/or policy.\n \nAuthors and editors should have a substantial and recent track record of publication and/or practice in psychology or law, and at least one should hold a doctorate in psychology or closely related behavioral science. If you have a proposal for a new book in the series or you would simply like more information, reach out to a member of the editorial team.

Wrightsman Book Award\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AP-LS Book Award was renamed the Lawrence S. Wrightsman Book Award by the American Psychology-Law Society executive committee in August 2019 based on Dr. Wrightsman’s contribution to the field, specifically through his books, as his psychology and law textbook is frequently used in the education of students in the field of psychology and law.\n\nThis year, the committee has selected, in 1st place, \"The Behavioral Code: The Hidden Ways the Law Makes us Better… or Worse,\" written by Adam Fine and Benjamin Van Rooij and published by Beacon Press in 2021; and in 2nd place, \"A Pattern of Violence: How the Law Classifies Crimes and What It Means for Justice.\" written by David Sklansky and published by Belknap Press in 2021. The work of the committee is concentrated over a few short months but requires intense reading and consideration. The nominated titles are always very strong, and it is never easy to pick the winners.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the Job or Postdoc Market?

    "text": "Welcome to the November 2021\n\n\nAmerican Psychology-Law Society (AP-LS) Newsletter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur monthly Newsletter provides information about activities, upcoming events, and resources to connect the psychology-law community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAP-LS aspires to excel as a valuable, effective, and influential organization advancing the science of psychology-law and the translation of psychology-law knowledge into practice and policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAP-LS Practice Committee Award\nRacial, Ethnic, and Cultural (REC) disparities in the criminal justice system necessitate that psychologists working in the field of psychology and the law use their knowledge and experience to combat them. Practicing clinicians are in a unique position to offer education, assessment, intervention and advocacy on issues of REC disparities, racism, and discrimination in the field of psychology and the law. However, a limited body of research, lack of practice guidelines on REC integration in forensic practice, and low representation of Black, Indigenous, People Of Color (BIPOC) professionals, limit such efforts. Mentorship of emerging practitioners in psychology and the law on such issues can bridge the gap of knowledge, application, and BIPOC representation in the field.\nThe AP-LS Practice Committee wants to recognize the substantive contributions of clinical mentors who educate and support emerging clinicians in psychology and the law with a lens toward the elimination of REC disparities and social justice. For these purposes, the term clinical refers to the practice of forensic psychology as described by Goldstein (2007), which involves: “The application of psychological research, theory, practice, and traditional and specialized methodology (e.g. interviewing, psychological testing, forensic assessment, and forensically relevant instruments) to provide information relevant to a legal question.”\nThe award for Outstanding Clinical Mentoring to Eliminate Racial, Ethnic and Cultural Disparities in the Field of Psychology and the Law will be conferred on a yearly basis. The Recipient will receive a $500.00 cash award, a plaque to be presented at the annual AP-LS conference, and will be featured in an AP-LS newsletter article, written by the practice committee, highlighting the recipients achievements and recommendations to other practitioners. Highlighting the recipient's mentorship practices and experiences can serve as a model for other professionals in the field of psychology and the law.\nFor more information, please click here\n\n\nCareer Corner\nTheCareerCorneris intended to highlight the individuals who work at the intersection of law and psychology, where they come from, how they got there and how their experiences influence their research, teaching, and/or practice. This edition ofCareerCornerprofilesLora Levett, PhD, a professor in the University of Florida’s Department of Sociology, Criminology, and Law and Associate Editor for Law and Human Behavior, currently serving as the 2021-2022 President of the American Psychology-Law Society (APA Division 41).\nTo read this column, please click here.\n\n\nTTC Committee’s Teaching and Mentoring Awards: Call for Nominations\nEach year the Teaching, Training, and Careers (TTC) Committee of the American Psychology-Law Society (AP-LS) confers two awards for outstanding teaching and mentoring. These awards recognize teaching excellence in the field of psychology and law in a variety of contexts, specifically the Outstanding Teaching and Mentoring Award and the Early Career Teaching and Mentoring Award. Winners will be announced at the AP-LS annual conference. In even number years, these are awarded to individuals from an undergraduate-only or MA-terminus program/department (Category 1 Awards) and in odd number years, to individuals from doctoral-granting or post-doctoral granting programs/departments (Category 2 Awards).\nBecause the AP-LS annual conference was not in person this year, the 2021 Teaching and Mentoring Awards were postponed. This means that all four awards will be conferred at the 2022 Annual Conference in Denver, CO. Nominees cannot apply for more than one of the four awards listed below.\nAward recipients receive $500 and a plaque at the AP-LS conference.\nNominations are due by December 15, 2021. Nominations can be emailed to ttc@apls.org\nFor more information, please click here.\n\n\nKeep AP-LS'S Voice Heard\nMembers of the American Psychological Association (APA) should receive their 2021 APA Ballot via e-mail on November 1. It is important that you promptly vote to keep AP-LS's voice heard at APA.\n\nYour vote on the apportionment ballot determines how many voting members AP-LS gets on APA's governing body, the Council of Representatives. Right now, AP-LS has two representatives: Jason Cantone and Margaret Bull Kovera.\n\nEach APA member is given 10 votes. Please give all 10 of your votes to Division 41/AP-LS. The more votes AP-LS gets, the more representatives we get on Council. In the past few years, we have gotten closer to gaining a third representative!\n\nThe APA Council of Representatives is scheduled to have a hybrid meeting on October 28-30. A summary will be provided in the December AP-LS newsletter. Expected topics include resolutions on homelessness, advancing health equity, and dismantling racism. Council will also be asked to pass guidelines regarding use of social media in psychological practice, and service to military members, veterans, and their families. There are also proposals regarding the creation of an organizational ombuds, term limits for Council members, and new measures to make Council policy making more efficient.\n\n\n2022 APA Convention: Call for Proposals\nThe American Psychology – Law Society invites presentations from any area in psychology and law at the 2022 APA convention. Invited are proposals for symposia, skill-building sessions, and posters. We especially encourage presentations that incorporate discussions around implementation science and knowledge translation, including:\n• Practice-oriented proposals (e.g., skills development workshops, case studies)\n• Translational proposals (e.g., translating research findings into clinical applications)\n• Effectively communicating research to policy makers and the public\n• The role social media has in research dissemination and advocacy (i.e., in the multi-cultural/diversity research and clinical space)\nProposals can be submitted through the official APA convention website from November 1st, 2021 to December 17th, 2021.\nTo view the official call and for more information, please click here.\n\n\nBook Award Committee Inviting Nominations\nThe AP-LS Book Award Committee invites nominations to recognize outstanding scholarship in psychology and law. This year we are accepting nominations for edited books published in 2019 and 2020.The deadline for nominations is November 19, 2021. Nominations (including self-nominations) and e-versions of the book should be sent to the Chair of the Committee:Elizabeth Foster, PhD (eefoster@widener.edu). The award rotates annually between edited and authored books. \n\n\nBRIDGE Committee Award Programs:Call for Applications 2022\nThe AP-LS BROADENING REPRESENTATIVE INCLUSION, DIVERSITY, AND GLOBAL EQUITY OR BRIDGE Committee (formerly known as Minority Affairs Committee or MAC) is seeking applicants for two award programs. As part of the BRIDGE Committee initiative to increase diversity within AP-LS, and the profession as a whole, these award programs support research for undergraduate and graduate students. Please take a few minutes to review the program descriptions below and consider if you or any students you know might be eligible, and encourage them to apply. Also, please feel free to forward this information to any colleagues who might be interested in these award programs.\nAward submissions will be accepted starting September 15th through December 15, 2021. Recipients will be announced in February 2022.\nAll applications for these awards can be submitted here.\nAccess Path to Psychology and Law Experience Program\nThe purpose of the Access Path to Psychology and Law Experience (AP) Program is to increase diversity within psychology and law by increasing the pipeline of competitive graduate school applicants from groups that currently are underrepresented in the field, including racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and disabled students. AP is designed to encourage faculty members to recruit students from underrepresented groups into their research labs. It provides financial support for the students to obtain meaningful research experience and attend the AP-LS conference as well as other opportunities for mentoring and development. It is the intention of the BRIDGE Committee that many of the students in the AP program will apply for graduate training related to psychology and law and ultimately become professionals in the field. The AP program primarily targets undergraduate students, but students from terminal master’s degree programs will also be considered.\nFor more information about the AP Program, please contact the program Chair, Dr. Jason Lawrence (jason.lawrence@dmh.mo.gov) and co-Chair, Dr. Evelyn Maeder (evelyn.maeder@carlton.ca).\nAP-LS Diversity in Psychology and Law Research Awards\nThe purpose of the Diversity in Psychology and Law Research Awards is to promote diversity within the American Psychology-Law Society by supporting student research on psycholegal issues related to diversity as well as research by students from underrepresented groups. Projects are eligible for consideration for this award if (1) they investigate topics related to psychology, law, diversity, and/or multiculturalism (e.g., research pertaining to psycholegal issues on race, gender, culture, sexual orientation, etc.) or (2) if the principal investigator is a member of an underrepresented group, including racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and students with disabilities. Consistent with the mission of the BRIDGE Committee, these awards are intended to facilitate the research of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in AP-LS, as well as research about issues of potential interest and importance to such groups.\nFor more information about the Diversity Program, please contact the program Chair, Dr. Logan Yelderman (layelderman@PVAMU.EDU) and co-Chair, Dr. Jodi Viljoen (jviljoen@sfu.ca).\nDiversity Travel Awards\nAs part of an initiative to increase diversity within AP-LS, the Minority Affairs Committee will provide travel awards to students from underrepresented groups (i.e., racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and students with disabilities).who are presenting research at the American Psychology-Law Society Conference. Seven competitive travel awards in the amount of $500 will be given.\nFor more information about the Diversity Travel Award program, please contact the program Chair, Dr. Elise Fenn (elise.fenn@csun.edu), and co-Chair Dr. Amanda NeMoyer (ann38@drexel.edu).\n\n\nOn The Job or Postdoc Market?

Mendez) submitted his report that was then transmitted by the UN Secretary-General to the UN General Assembly. In this report it was stated that\n“The Special Rapporteur…advocates the development of a universal protocol identifying a set of standards for non-coercive interviewing methods and procedural safeguards that ought, as a matter of law and policy, to be applied at a minimum to all interviews by law enforcement officials, military and intelligence personnel and other bodies with investigative mandates.”\nWhen mentioning this this “universal protocol” the UN Special Rapporteur noted that\n“Encouragingly, some States have moved away from accusatorial, manipulative and confession-driven interviewing models with a view to increasing accurate and reliable information and minimizing the risks of unreliable information and miscarriages of justice” and that “The essence of an alternative information-gathering model was first captured by the PEACE model of interviewing adopted in 1992 in England and Wales…investigative interviewing can provide positive guidance for the protocol…”.\nIn light of his report a relatively small steering committee was set up to write such a document. Over the last three years our committee produced various comprehensive drafts that were deemed to be far too long (one being at around 140 pages) for worldwide policy makers. Eventually we managed to hit the target of it being under 40 pages.\nThis finalised version is now publicly available here.\n\n\nCALL FOR BOOK PROPOSALS\nThe American Psychology-Law Society invites proposals for new authored and edited volumes on psychology-law topics for its book series (APA Publishers). If you are considering authoring or editing a new volume, please reach out to a member of the editorial team. We would be glad to discuss your ideas with you and provide you with the guidelines for proposals.\n\nBrian Cutler, Editor (brian.cutler@ontariotechu.ca)\nMonique Bowen, Associate Editor (mbowen2@antioch.edu)\nHeather Flowe, Associate Editor (H.Flowe@bham.ac.uk)\nJemour Maddux, Associate Editor (jmaddux@lambmadduxgroup.com)\n\n\n\n\n\nON THE JOB OR POSTDOC MARKET?AP-LS JOB POSTINGS\nCheck out AP-LS's Job Postings Page for up-to-date information on available psychology-law positionshere.\n\n\nAP-LS CONTACTS\nEmail addresses for all current EC members and Committee Chairs can be found here.\n\n\nNEWSLETTER ARCHIVES\nArchives of the newsletter are available athttps://ap-ls.org/newsletter."

As they explained, Black women are subject to both racism and sexism, yet they are nonetheless discriminated against even within feminist and anti-racist movements. Forty years later, Black women continue to face greater wage gaps and greater barriers to career advancement than do White women.\nKeeping this historical framework in mind, the American Psychology-Law Society (AP-LS; APA Division 41) Professional Development of Women (PDW) Committee hopes to provide space for Black women within the organization to bring light to the issues this group uniquely faces within both AP-LS and within the field of psychology and law at large. The proposed panel will discuss barriers to success, relevant resources, the role of mentorship, and paths to professional growth for Black women in the field of psychology and law. This panel will provide support and guidance among Black women while encouraging all members of AP-LS (who, as a whole, are disproportionately White) to consider the experiences of their peers and colleagues through an intersectional lens.\nRegistration is required, register here!\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_3Bms1z8DSQGMjYOGbJDMTA\nThe deadline to register is 8/5/2021.\nNote: The day before the presentation, you will receive an email with the link to join the webinar.\nWe look forward to you joining us!

The apportionment ballot determines the composition of the Council of Representatives (COR) and is sent electronically to all APA voting members. Voting members can also access their ballots at my.apa.org. Each voter is allowed ten votes that will determine the number of seats that divisions and state associations have on the APA’s Council of Representatives, its main decision-making body. At present we have two seats on COR, but there is no guarantee that we will keep these seats. Moreover, in the last apportionment process, a third seat on COR was in reach if more of our members completed their ballots and if those who did allocated more of their votes to APLS/41. We urge you to allocate all ten of your votes to APLS – Division 41 of APA. The election will close on December 15, 2021.\nAPA Updates\nAPA Council met in October, passing important resolutions including APA’s Apology to People of Color for the Role of the APA in Promoting, Perpetuating, and Failing to Challenge Racism, Racial Discrimination, and Human Hierarchy in the US. In addition, APA Council passed a resolution entitled “The role of psychology and the APA in dismantling systemic racism against people of color in the US” and a resolution on Advancing Health Equity in Psychology. For further details on the APA Council meeting, please click here.\nIn addition, applications are now open for APA’s 2022-2023 executive branch and congressional fellowships. The deadline to submit applications is January 3, 2022.\nAPA’s year-long congressional and executive branch fellowships in Washington, D.C., provide a unique opportunity for psychologists to gain experience in public policy and broaden awareness of the value of psychology research within the federal government. They are given opportunities to contribute directly to legislative and regulatory matters.

It focuses the attention of scholarly, public policy, and legal audiences on such work. We encourage and invite submissions from members of the Society especially about topics with contemporary relevance.\nThe journal publishes theoretical and empirical articles that\n\ncritically evaluate the contributions and potential contributions of psychology to legal and public policy issues;\nassess the desirability of different public policy and legal alternatives in light of the scientific knowledge base in psychology;\narticulate research needs that address public policy and legal issues for which there is currently insufficient theoretical and empirical knowledge;\npresent empirical work that makes a significant contribution to the application of psychological knowledge to public policy or the law; and\nexamine public policy and legal issues relating to the conduct of psychology and related disciplines (e.g., human subjects, protection policies; informed consent procedures).\n\nThe journal ensures that authors benefit from peer review, scientific and legal input, and editorial guidance from both psychologists and lawyers. We publish both original research and scholarly reviews.\nTo maximize the robustness and generalizability of research articles published in the journal, authors are required to make their data, materials, and analysis code publicly available or to explain why that is not possible. Every published article is included in APA PsycInfo® and APA PsycArticles®, the world’s most comprehensive and widely used psychological databases, as well as in LexisNexis, the key legal database. Published articles are thus available to a global audience of over 4,000 institutions and 80 million potential users and this may account for its high and rising impact.\nThe journal’s scope statement can be read here: https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/law.\nProspective authors are also invited to contact the Editor, Michael Lamb (mel37@cam.ac.uk) with questions about the suitability of their proposed submissions.\n\n\nAP-LS Grants-in-Aid Committee – Call for Proposals\nThe AP-LS Grants-in-Aid Committee is accepting proposals for small grants (maximum of $1,500) to support empirical graduate research that addresses psycholegal issues. Interested individuals should submit a complete award application via the AP-LS proposal management system by 11:59 p.m. PST on January 15th, 2022. Questions should be emailed to the Grants-in-Aid chair  at grantsinaid@ap-ls.org. \n\n\nTTC Committee’s Teaching and Mentoring Awards: Call for Nominations\nEach year the Teaching, Training, and Careers (TTC) Committee of the American Psychology-Law Society (AP-LS) confers two awards for outstanding teaching and mentoring. These awards recognize teaching excellence in the field of psychology and law in a variety of contexts, specifically the Outstanding Teaching and Mentoring Award and the Early Career Teaching and Mentoring Award. Winners will be announced at the AP-LS annual conference. In even number years, these are awarded to individuals from an undergraduate-only or MA-terminus program/department (Category 1 Awards) and in odd number years, to individuals from doctoral-granting or post-doctoral granting programs/departments (Category 2 Awards).\nBecause the AP-LS annual conference was not in person this year, the 2021 Teaching and Mentoring Awards were postponed. This means that all four awards will be conferred at the 2022 Annual Conference in Denver, CO. Nominees cannot apply for more than one of the four awards listed below.\nAward recipients receive $500 and a plaque at the AP-LS conference.\nNominations are due by December 15, 2021.

AP is designed to encourage faculty members to recruit students from underrepresented groups into their research labs. It provides financial support for the students to obtain meaningful research experience and attend the AP-LS conference as well as other opportunities for mentoring and development. It is the intention of the BRIDGE Committee that many of the students in the AP program will apply for graduate training related to psychology and law and ultimately become professionals in the field. The AP program primarily targets undergraduate students, but students from terminal master’s degree programs will also be considered.\nFor more information about the AP Program, please contact the program Chair, Dr. Jason Lawrence (jason.lawrence@dmh.mo.gov) and co-Chair, Dr. Evelyn Maeder (evelyn.maeder@carlton.ca).\nAP-LS Diversity in Psychology and Law Research Awards\nThe purpose of the Diversity in Psychology and Law Research Awards is to promote diversity within the American Psychology-Law Society by supporting student research on psycholegal issues related to diversity as well as research by students from underrepresented groups. Projects are eligible for consideration for this award if (1) they investigate topics related to psychology, law, diversity, and/or multiculturalism (e.g., research pertaining to psycholegal issues on race, gender, culture, sexual orientation, etc.) or (2) if the principal investigator is a member of an underrepresented group, including racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and students with disabilities. Consistent with the mission of the BRIDGE Committee, these awards are intended to facilitate the research of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in AP-LS, as well as research about issues of potential interest and importance to such groups.\nFor more information about the Diversity Program, please contact the program Chair, Dr. Logan Yelderman (layelderman@PVAMU.EDU) and co-Chair, Dr. Jodi Viljoen (jviljoen@sfu.ca).\nDiversity Travel Awards\nAs part of an initiative to increase diversity within AP-LS, the Minority Affairs Committee will provide travel awards to students from underrepresented groups (i.e., racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and students with disabilities).who are presenting research at the American Psychology-Law Society Conference.

The leaves and branches are visible, but the roots are the elements from which everything grew. Knowing and understanding the roots and how our own tree of knowledge grew tells a lot about who we are and where we came from. The emergence of psychology and law as a modern field of scholarship was marked by the founding of the American Psychology-Law Society.\n\n\n\nThomas Grisso & Stanley L. Brodsky in The Roots of Modern Psychology and Law: A Narrative History, p. xiii\n\n\nWhile Munsterberg’s (1908) On the Witness Stand: Essays on Psychology and Crime is often credited as the seed to the law-psychology discipline, the field did not truly take root until the 1970s. Following a dormant period (1930s to 1960s), law-psychology was reawakened for several reasons including: the development of clinical and social psychology as disciplines working within legal contexts; consciousness in human rights, civil liberties, and social justice; and federal case law supporting clinical psychologists providing testimony (Jenkins v. U.S., 1962) and agencies developed to support scientific research (Center for Crime and Delinquency, first directed by Saleem Shah).\nIn 1968, at the American Psychological Association (APA) convention in San Francisco, thirteen psychologists, initiated by a psychologist and lawyer Jay Ziskin (and first president), met and discussed the intersection of psychology and law and conceptualized a society to support law-psychology interdisciplinary work. The next year, there was a mimeographed newsletter and 101 charter members, with $202 in funds that were generated from the $2 dues of each member.\nThe first conference was held in San Francisco in June 1974, with approximately 20 to 30 presenter/attendees. In 1977, Bruce Sales established both the law-psychology book series and Law and Human Behavior (LHB). A few years later, LHB was designated the official journal of AP-LS. Then in 1981, AP-LS became Division 41 of the American Psychological Association.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrisso, T., & Brodsky, S. L. (Eds.). (2018).

ECPs face a number of unique challenges and issues when making the transition from graduate study to professional life. More than ever, today’s ECPs are likely to struggle with juggling multiple roles. Challenges faced by ECPs include financial concerns or strains, meeting licensure requirements, developing a professional identify, obtaining tenure, and enhancement of health and wellness, among other issues (Green & Hawley, 2009).\nThe purpose of this award is to support AP-LS members who are ECPs in conducting research related to psychology and law. It is the committee’s desire that these awards are not limited only to members who are psychologists, but instead open to AP-LS members from all backgrounds.\nAward amounts\nFunding up to $5,000 per award is available. Funding should primarily support research activities and data collection efforts (e.g., equipment, participant payments, software data transcription, hourly payment for research assistants, and expenses incurred at sites away from the home institution while collecting data). Travel to conferences and salary expenses are not eligible costs. Funds for successful proposals will be awarded to the PI’s academic institution (via the institution’s Office of Sponsored Research or Foundation). No institutional indirect cost recovery will be permitted.\n\n\nTo receive an award:\n\nThe applicant must be an Early Career Professional, defined by APA as those within ten years of receiving their last degree.\nApplicants and any co-applicants must be classified as ECPs upon the application deadline for that year.\nApplicants may submit only one award proposal per funding cycle. In addition, to maximize the impact of the program, a strong preference will be given to those applicants who never have received an AP-LS ECP Grants-in-Aid.\nUnder exceptional circumstances, the committee may consider a second award. The possibility of a second award will be a rare occurrence, and the previous award must be completed prior to submitting a second proposal.\nProposals that represent “seed money” for larger projects and proposals that are for “standalone” projects will be accepted.\nApplicants are encouraged but not required to secure matched funding from employers to support the proposed research.\n\n\nAll applicants and any co-applicants must be active members of AP-LS.\n\n\nThese awards are not limited only to AP-LS members who are psychologists; they are open to members from all backgrounds.\nBut students are not eligible to receive an award.\n\n\n\nSubmit a complete proposal to the online portal by October 15 at 11:59 PST.\nClick to Apply\n\n\nProposal should include:\n\nPI and co-PI personal information and affiliations;\nstatus of the human subjects review for the project (approval must be obtained prior to disbursement of the award);\nexplanation regarding attempts to secure matched funding from employer (Contact the ECP committee with any questions);\nA 150-word abstract describing the proposed research;\nA five-page single-spaced project description with 1-inch margins and 12-pt Times New Roman font or similar. You can download the formatted template here. The description should include:\n\n\nStatement of the problem: A clear statement of the research problem and its significance to psychology and law;\nBackground and aims: a concise overview of the relevant empirical literature, theoretical background, and/or law related to the research problem;\nMethod: a detailed description of the methodology and analytical strategies to be used. Although not required, applicants are encouraged to include an Open Science Practice Statement (or plan) with their application;\nSignificance: a brief description of the significance of the project within the field of psychology and law.\n\n\nA reference list (does not count toward the page limit);\nA CV for each PI and co-PI contributing to the project, including a list of “significant collaborators” that includes dissertation and master’s thesis advisors, current and past students, co-authors within the last 5 years, editors who have edited a book in which you have a chapter published, and authors who have published in a book you have edited;\nA project timeline and a proposed budget that details anticipated expenditures and a budget justification that links the requested funds to the proposed activities (If the applicant has secured additional funding for the proposed research from another funding source, please provide an explanation of how the external funds will be used—additional funding is not required and is not considered among the evaluation criteria);\nSuggestions for at least five suggested reviewers for the project with expertise in the content area of the proposal: Suggested reviewers should not include anyone who might have a significant conflict of interest in reviewing the proposal (defined as “significant collaborators” in CV section). Please include the full name and email address of each suggested reviewer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep in mind\n\n\n\nAll project-related materials (i.e., abstract, description, timeline, budget) should be blinded. Failure to blind materials will disqualify the applicants from the program.\n\n\n\n\nApplications first will be reviewed by at least two external reviewers; proposals will be subject to blind review. After receiving external reviews, the ECP Committee will meet to evaluate the proposals and to make funding decisions. Both the external reviews and a panel summary will be provided to the applicant, regardless of award decision.\nIn evaluating each proposal, outside reviewers and the panel will evaluate and provide feedback about the intellectual merit and broader impacts of the project using the following criteria:\n\nProposal Quality: What is the quality of the proposed project? Is it methodologically rigorous? Is the method thorough and complete?\nProposal Contribution: What is the potential contribution of the proposal to the field of psychology and law? Does it have potential to contribute to advancing knowledge in the field?\nProposal Originality: Does the proposal present an original idea in psychology and law? Does the proposal use new or creative methods or viewpoints to address old problems?\nProposal Broader Impacts: Does the proposal have potential to benefit society or advance societal outcomes? (see NSF Broader Impact criteria for ideas of broader impacts to address)\nOverall rating: What is the overall assessment of the proposal? What is the funding recommendation?\n\n\n\nAwardees must submit yearly progress reports on Nov. 15 of each year until the project is complete.\nUpon completion of the project, awardees must submit an end-of-project report and should consider presenting the results of their research at either a subsequent AP-LS conference or in the division’s APA program.\n\n\nThe Early Career Professional’s Committee is introducing a mentoring program for early career researchers who are planning to apply for the Grant in Aid (GiA).\nThrough the mentoring program, you can connect with a researcher who was awarded the GiA and ask them questions regarding their experience with the grant, the application process (beyond practical information provided in the general guidance), the role the grant had in their career, or questions related to their proposal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPlease note that mentors are not reviewers or co-authors and should provide general support in the application process.\nIf you’d like to connect with a mentor, please think about three keywords related to your project and send us an email to the ECP committee and include GiA Mentoring program connection request: [your keywords] as the subject. We will do our best to connect you with a mentor."

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nApplications should be emailed directly to the Chair of the Practice Committee at practice@ap-ls.org before annual November 1 deadline.\nAbout Practice CommitteeSubmit application\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptionBackgroundEligibilityHow to Apply\n\n\nThe AP-LS Practice Committee Award for Outstanding Practitioner Mentoring to Eliminate Racial, Ethnic and Cultural (REC) Disparities Recognizes the substantive contributions of clinical mentors who educate and support emerging clinicians in psychology and law with a lens toward the elimination of REC disparities, and social justice.\nRecipients will receive a $500 cash award, a plaque to be presented at the annual AP-LS conference, and a feature article written by the practice committee members in the practice committee section of the AP-LS newsletter highlighting the recipients’ achievements and recommendations.\n\n\nREC disparities in the criminal justice system (CJS) necessitate that practicing psychologists working in the field of psychology and the law use their knowledge and experience to combat them. Practitioners are in a unique position to offer education, assessment, intervention and advocacy on issues of REC disparities, racism, and discrimination in the field of psychology and the law. However, a limited body of research, lack of practice guidelines on REC integration in forensic practice, and low representation of Black, Indigenous, People Of Color (BIPOC) professionals, limit such efforts. Mentorship of emerging practitioners in psychology and the law on such issues can bridge the gap of knowledge, application, and BIPOC representation in the field.\nThe AP-LS Practice Committee wants to recognize the substantive contributions of practitioner mentors who educate and support emerging clinicians in psychology and the law with a lens toward the elimination of REC disparities and social justice. For these purposes, we use Goldstein’s (2007) definition of the practice of psychology and the law: “The application of psychological research, theory, practice, and traditional and specialized methodology (e.g. interviewing, psychological testing, forensic assessment, and forensically relevant instruments) to provide information relevant to a legal question.”\nThe award for Outstanding Practitioner Mentoring to Eliminate Racial, Ethnic and Cultural (REC) Disparities in the Field of Psychology and the Law, will be conferred on a yearly basis. The recipient will receive a $500 cash award, a plaque to be presented at the annual AP-LS conference, and will be featured in an AP-LS newsletter article, written by the practice committee, highlighting the recipient’s achievements and recommendations to other practitioners. Highlighting the recipient’s mentorship practices and experiences can serve as a model for other professionals in the field of psychology and the law.\n\nReferences\nGoldstein, A.M. (2007).

It can also be so-called “informal mentorship” where the mentor has dedicated their personal time to assist and support emerging clinicians outside formal institutional affiliations (e.g. an African American forensic psychologist who regularly mentors other BIPOC early career psychologists in their area).\nExcellence in mentorship can take many shapes and forms. A common thread would be mentoring emerging clinicians, regardless of race or ethnicity, on using their specialized skills and knowledge as forensic psychologists to reduce REC disparities.\nThe practitioner’s mentorship has had a significant impact in the system in which they operate (e.g. supporting increased training opportunities on BIPOC issues, helping increase BIPOC representation in the field of psychology and the law, supporting antiracist professional identities for emerging forensic psychologists).\nSelf-nominations are encouraged; the candidate does not have to be an AP-LS member.\n\n\nThe nomination package should be converted into a PDF file and emailed directly to the chair of the award committee. Self-nominations are encouraged; the candidate does not have to be an AP-LS member.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNomination package (max 25 pages) should include:\n\n\n\n\nNominee’s statement (~1-2 pages) describing how the nominated psychologist meets the criteria for the award, their focus and approach to mentoring and how it centers BIPOC issues. For example, their support of BIPOC trainees/staff under their supervision and/or work with non-BIPOC trainees/staff on issues relevant to BIPOC populations in psychology and the law. It should also include their goals and accomplishments associated with the field of psychology and the law\nA copy of the nominee’s curriculum vitae\nA letter of support from a mentee (e.g. former or current) focusing on the impact the individual had in their professional development and understanding of BIPOC issues in FMH."

All email communications will come from caps@paloaltou.eduPlease make sure this email is whitelisted on your email provider.\n\n\n\nWhat to expect at the conference\n\nTo receive CEs for a conference session, you must attend the session in its entirety. There will be sign-in/sign-out sheets for each session located at the back of the room; please print your full name & email address clearly to document your attendance at the session. This must be done for each CE session you attend.\nYou must complete an evaluation for each CE-eligible session you attend. The evaluation links for each day of the conference will be sent via email prior to the start of the first session. Please do not access these links until after each of the live conference sessions.\nYou will be able to download & save a PDF certificate upon completion of the evaluation. A copy will also be emailed to the email used at registration within 1-week of the close of the conference.\nIf you need support from CONCEPT for CE/Certificate needs, please visit the CONCEPT booth (between Franklin Hall and the escalators) during the conference.\n\n\n\n\n\nSymposia, Paper, and Data Blitz Sessions\nSymposia sessions are 80 minutes long and paper and data blitz sessions are 60 minutes long. All sessions will have an assigned chair who will be responsible for ensuring that approximately 10 minutes are reserved for questions. The remaining time should be divided evenly across all the scheduled presenters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nWhile Audio/Visual should be available in session rooms, note that Internet will not be. Thus, presenters need to ensure that their A/V content is stored on their computer and thumb drive so that it can be transferred to the session room computer and played locally.\n\n\n\n\nPosters\nPoster Sizing: The poster boards for mounting a poster are 4 ft (height) x 8 ft (width). Presenters are free to print any size poster that will fit within this space. Pushpins will be provided.\nPoster Board Numbering: Posters are numbered in the conference program so that the number for the poster indicates the correct board on which the poster should be hung. Poster presenters should refer to these numbers to identify the poster board to hang their poster.\n\n\n\nPre-conference Workshops will take place on Wednesday March 15.\nLearn more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2023 AP-LS Program Grid and Schedule is available to download and view online!\nConference Program"

Find a Q&A with Dr. Anumba HERE. \nThe Practice Committee is currently accepting award nominations for 2024.  Additional information about the award can be found at:  https://ap-ls.org/awards/ Nomination packages are due January 15th and should be emailed to  the chair of the award subcommittee at practice@ap-ls.org. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegal Update: Taking Charge of Dismissing Charges: Implications of Pennsylvania’s Commonwealth v. Humphrey for Individuals Found Unrestorable to Competency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has long been held that criminal defendants who are unrestorable to competency cannot be indefinitely detained. Under Jackson v. Indiana (1972), individuals cannot be detained for purposes of competency restoration for any longer than the reasonable period of time necessary to determine if that individual is restorable to competency. If an individual is determined to be unrestorable, they must be discharged from detention. If there is a question about dangerousness, the individual can be civilly committed. But what happens to their charges? If the charges are less serious, they are often dropped; more serious charges often remain open.  But what happens when an individual does not meet civil commitment criteria AND is facing more serious charges? Several commentators have noted this to be a major gap in the forensic behavioral health system.  In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, this gap was recently addressed in the case of Commonwealth v. Humphrey (2022). This Legal Update will explore the implications of the Humphrey decision, including an analysis on the recent developments in Pennsylvania competency law and both the legal and clinical considerations in the Humphrey decision. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly Career Professionals Practitioner Grant\n*DEADLINE EXTENSION*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you an Early Career Professional who practices primarily as a practitioner within the field of psychology and law?

The intent of this grant initiative is to advance a more interdisciplinary science that addresses understudied topics in psychology and law, as well as to broaden the discipline and amplify its practical impact. Proposed projects must investigate new or understudied topics in psychology and law, enhance the diversification of psychology and law research through novel theoretical or methodological approaches that are cross-disciplinary in nature, and/or promote the impact of research by considering novel populations or new problems or processes within the legal system. Collaboration with practitioners or policymakers is encouraged. Successful proposals are expected to involve projects with the potential to transform and impact the field by furthering novel lines of research inquiry and/or facilitating new cross-disciplinary collaborations. As part of the AP-LS initiative toward a more inclusive society, grant applications that specifically address disadvantaged groups or understudied topic areas in psychology and law will be given preference. This includes funding scholars from traditionally underprivileged backgrounds. Proposals may be submitted into one of two funding categories:\n \n1.     Small/Seed proposals ($1,000-$5,000 for a 12-month research period)\n2.     Large proposals ($15,000-$50,000 over a 12-18 month research period)\n \nFunding should primarily support research activities and data collection efforts. Support for research assistants and necessary travel may be requested, but should not constitute the majority of the requested funds. No funds can be used to support the salary of the PI or co-PI. Funds for successful proposals will be awarded to the PI’s academic institution (via the institution’s Office of Sponsored Research or Foundation). No institutional indirect cost recovery will be permitted, and proposals submitted for consideration by this program must not be submitted for consideration by other grant programs (including AP-LS programs). Proposals submitted but not funded in previous funding cycles may be resubmitted, but all proposals will be evaluated as new proposals.\n \nResearchers may submit a maximum of one proposal to the large grant mechanism and one proposal to the small grant mechanism. That is, researchers can be an author or co-author on a maximum of one proposal to each of the grant categories. Students may not be PIs on proposals, although they may be Co-PIs.\n \nPre-proposal submissions will open on October 4th. The submission deadline is October 15th, 2023. Selected pre-proposal submissions will be notified in November if they are selected to submit a full proposal. Full proposals will be due in mid-December.\n \nThe application portal and more information on applications can be found at https://ap-ls.org/awards/grants/impactgrant.

We publish authored and edited volumes on current issues at the intersection of psychology and law. Books are typically a state of the science synthesis of a body of existing research with implications for practice and/or policy. Authors and editors should have a substantial and recent track record of publication and/or practice in psychology or law, and at least one should hold a doctorate in psychology or closely related behavioral science. If you have a proposal for a new book in the series or you would simply like more information, reach out to a member of the editorial team.

On the other hand, practitioners, especially those who work solely in private practice, often lack comparable levels of support. In addition to the costs associated with travel, clinicians may incur a loss of income when they attend a conference. The CTG will address the unique financial barriers clinicians face that make it difficult for them to attend the conference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDegree of Support\n\n\n\nThe maximum amount of support provided by the grant will vary depending on the amount of support needed or requested. It will also depend on the applicant’s stage of career:\n\nPost-doctoral applicants may apply for a $600 maximum amount of support.\nEarly-career applicants may apply for a $500 maximum amount of support.\nMid to Advanced Career applicants may apply for a $400 maximum amount of support.\n\n\n\n\n\nEligible individuals must be AP-LS members. Any practicing psychologist, starting from the Post-Doctoral, Early Career, Mid and Advanced career level, may apply. The applicants will have to self-identify as primarily practicing psychologists (defined below) in the field of psychology and the law. For this purpose, a practicing clinician spends at least 75% of their work week providing direct services associated with psychology and the law or they are in a postdoctoral program training to become a practitioner in the area of psychology and the law.\nPreference will be given to psychologists at any level who do not have or have limited institutional support to attend conferences, such as private practitioners or practitioners in public non-academic institutions. Special preference may be given to practicing psychologists who are presenting at the conference and have not previously been granted the grant. The funds shall be used for travel costs associated with attending the AP-LS conference exclusively.\n\n\nApplications are due by December 1, 2023\nComplete CTG Application here"
