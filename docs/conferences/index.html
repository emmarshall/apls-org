<p><strong>Symposium sessions</strong> are 80 minutes long. Allow approximately 10 minutes for questions and comments from the audience. Divide the remaining time evenly between the presenters and the discussant.</p>
<p><strong>Paper sessions</strong> are 60 minutes long. Most sessions have four or five papers; therefore, each presenter should plan to have 10-12 minutes to present. This will allow time at the end for audience questions. A chair will be assigned to paper sessions and will make introductions, help keep time, as well as guide questions at the end of the session.</p>
<p><strong>Data-Blitz sessions</strong> are 60 minutes long. Data-blitz presenters have a maximum of 5 minutes each (3-5 slides), followed by approximately 10 minutes of questions from the audience at the end of the session.</p>

<div class="session-description">
<p>First, help us honor our 2024 award winners. Then, stay for an opening plenary session on Forensic Science. From crime labs to autopsies, improper forensic science is a leading cause of known wrongful convictions—yet it has historically received less research attention than other such causes. That tide is now turning, as researchers are shedding light on the potential for unconscious bias and human error in forensic experts’ decisions and working with community partners to strengthen forensic science policy and practice. In this session, a panel of psychologists, practitioners, attorneys, and policy experts will discuss ongoing progress and future directions in terms of rectifying past injustices and optimizing the human element of forensic science.</p>

<div class="session-description">
<p>For at least the past decade, the United States has experienced a grave “competency crisis,” That is, orders for competency evaluation and restoration have been increasing far more than states can provide those restoration services. One consequence of this public mental health crisis are lengthy waitlists of defendants with psychiatric illness, waiting for many months in jails for restoration treatment, as their symptoms grow worse. These conditions have prompted lawsuits and reform efforts in many states, though most states still struggle. Amid this crisis, California is worth watching. Their waitlist reached nearly 2,000 (second largest in the country), but through a variety of innovative practices has decreased by roughly 80%.</p>
<p>This panel features California leaders who pioneered strategic practices to address the competence crisis. Psychiatrist Kate Warburton, director of the Department of State Hospitals, has overseen broad system reform efforts that extend far beyond the state hospitals. Psychiatrist Kristen Ochoa has overseen a one-of-a-kind outpatient restoration program for Los Angeles County. Finally, Judge James Bianco has been an innovator in his own docket, and a national voice in addressing the competency systems.</p>

least the past decade, the United States has experienced a grave “competency crisis,” That is, orders for competency evaluation and restoration have been increasing far more than states can provide those restoration services. One consequence of this public mental health crisis are lengthy waitlists of defendants with psychiatric illness, waiting for many months in jails for restoration treatment, as their symptoms grow worse. These conditions have prompted lawsuits and reform efforts in many states, though most states still struggle. Amid this crisis, California is worth watching. Their waitlist reached nearly 2,000 (second largest in the country), but through a variety of innovative practices has decreased by roughly 80%. This panel features California leaders who pioneered strategic practices to address the competence crisis. Psychiatrist Kate Warburton, director of the Department of State Hospitals, has overseen broad system reform efforts that extend far beyond the state hospitals. Psychiatrist Kristen Ochoa has overseen a one-of-a-kind outpatient restoration program for Los Angeles County. Finally, Judge James Bianco has been an innovator in his own docket, and a national voice in addressing the competency systems."]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"schedule-detail"},"children":[{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"detail-label"},"children":["Location"]},"Beaudry

<div class="session-description">
<p>To achieve social justice, courts must find new ways to respond to those who engage in criminal behavior. It is well known that the “felon” label produces a wide variety of collateral consequences (e.g., employment, education, housing, voting) and the effects are even worse for young men of color. In an attempt to change how the justice system responds to felony offenses, Orange County, CA created a Young Adult Court (YAC) for young men between the ages of 18 and 25.</p>
<p>The goal of this program is to reduce recidivism and promote positive life outcomes by (1) providing developmentally appropriate support to participants of the program and (2) permit them the opportunity to have their felony charge reduced to a misdemeanor or dismissed. To highlight how this court was created, the Presiding Judge of Orange County will describe what it takes to implement a Young Adult Court. The District Attorney and Public Defender will highlight the challenges each of their offices face. Finally, Dr.&nbsp;Cauffman will present preliminary data from the randomized control trial to provide insight into the effectiveness as well as the challenges between those processed in Young Adult Court and those processed through the traditional court system.</p>

It is well known that the “felon” label produces a wide variety of collateral consequences (e.g., employment, education, housing, voting) and the effects are even worse for young men of color. In an attempt to change how the justice system responds to felony offenses, Orange County, CA created a Young Adult Court (YAC) for young men between the ages of 18 and 25. The goal of this program is to reduce recidivism and promote positive life outcomes by (1) providing developmentally appropriate support to participants of the program and (2) permit them the opportunity to have their felony charge reduced to a misdemeanor or dismissed. To highlight how this court was created, the Presiding Judge of Orange County will describe what it takes to implement a Young Adult Court. The District Attorney and Public Defender will highlight the challenges each of their offices face. Finally, Dr. Cauffman will present preliminary data from the randomized control trial to provide insight into the effectiveness as well as the challenges between those processed in Young Adult Court and those processed through the traditional court system.","Break",null,null,"Practice Committee","Student Committee",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Break","Practice Committee",null,"Data

must find new ways to respond to those who engage in criminal behavior. It is well known that the “felon” label produces a wide variety of collateral consequences (e.g., employment, education, housing, voting) and the effects are even worse for young men of color. In an attempt to change how the justice system responds to felony offenses, Orange County, CA created a Young Adult Court (YAC) for young men between the ages of 18 and 25. The goal of this program is to reduce recidivism and promote positive life outcomes by (1) providing developmentally appropriate support to participants of the program and (2) permit them the opportunity to have their felony charge reduced to a misdemeanor or dismissed. To highlight how this court was created, the Presiding Judge of Orange County will describe what it takes to implement a Young Adult Court. The District Attorney and Public Defender will highlight the challenges each of their offices face. Finally, Dr. Cauffman will present preliminary data from the randomized control trial to provide insight into the effectiveness as well as the challenges between those processed in Young Adult Court and those processed through the traditional court system."]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{},"children":[{"name":"div","attribs":{"style":{"font-weight":"900","line-height":"1.3","font-size":".875rem","color":"#343a40"}},"children":["Lunch

<p><i class="fa-solid fa-plane" aria-label="plane"></i> <strong><em>Recommended Transportation</em></strong><br> For attendees flying in to Los Angeles, the LAX FlyAway runs from LAX to the Union Station train station in downtown LA and is $10. The LAX FlyAway runs from LAX every 30 minutes and from Union Station every hour. Union Station is a short Uber or cab ride to the hotel but is a great option for individuals arriving alone as Ubers and cabs directly from the airport can be costly.</p>
