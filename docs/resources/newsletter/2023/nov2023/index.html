<p>The Practice Committee’s Award for Outstanding Practitioner Mentoring for the Elimination of Racial, Ethnic, and Cultural (REC) Disparities recognizes practitioners whose mentorship helps reduce REC disparities in psychology and the law. Practitioners are in a unique position to offer education, assessment, intervention and advocacy on issues of REC disparities, racism, and discrimination in the legal systems. However, a limited body of research, lack of practice guidelines on REC integration in forensic practice, and low representation of Black, Indigenous, People Of Color (BIPOC) professionals, limit such efforts. Mentorship of emerging practitioners in psychology and the law on such issues can bridge the gap of knowledge, application, and BIPOC representation in the field.</p>
<p>The Practice Committee is currently accepting award nominations for 2024. Additional information about the award can be found at: https://ap-ls.org/awards/. Nomination packages are due January 15th and should be emailed to the chair of the award subcommittee at practice@ap-ls.org.</p>

<p>Members of the American Psychological Association (APA) should receive their 2023 APA Ballot via e-mail on November 1. It is important that you promptly vote to keep AP-LS’s voice heard within APA.</p>
<p>The ballot will include votes on APA bylaws changes and an apportionment ballot which determines how many voting members AP-LS gets on APA’s governing body, the Council of Representatives (Council). In the past year, your AP-LS Council representatives (Margaret Bull Kovera and Jason Cantone) successfully passed APA legislation regarding the removal of mental health treatment questions from bar exam character and fitness examinations and submitted legislation for APA to oppose involuntary solitary confinement of juveniles in justice settings as well as legislation to better support parents with disabilities, including in child custody and foster care settings.</p>
<p>Each APA voting member is given 10 apportionment votes to allot across APA divisions and state provincial and territorial psychological associations (SPTAs). We ask that you give all ten of your votes to Division 41 / AP-LS. With more votes, we can obtain a third AP-LS Council representative seat to better address the many research and practice issues that matter to AP-LS. Please make sure to vote! If you are an APA member and do not receive an apportionment ballot, contact elections@apa.org.</p>

<section id="clinicians-travel-grants-call-for-applications" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="clinicians-travel-grants-call-for-applications">Clinicians’ Travel Grants: Call for Applications</h3>
<ol type="I">
<li><p>Description:</p>
<p>The Practice Committee is sponsoring twenty (20) Clinicians’ Travel Grants (CTG) to address disparities in access to funds available to clinicians to attend the AP-LS conference.</p>
<p>Psychologists in academia often have paid time off and can receive university sponsored funds to cover costs associated with attending conferences. On the other hand, practitioners, especially those who work solely in private practice, often lack comparable levels of support. In addition to the costs associated with travel, clinicians may incur a loss of income when they attend a conference. The CTG will address the unique financial barriers clinicians face that make it difficult for them to attend the conference.</p></li>
<li><p>Eligibility:</p>
<p>Eligible individuals must be AP-LS members. Any practicing psychologist, starting from the Post-Doctoral, Early Career, Mid and Advanced career level, may apply. The applicants will have to self-identify as primarily practicing psychologists (defined below) in the field of psychology and the law. For this purpose, a practicing clinician spends at least 75% of their work week providing direct services associated with psychology and the law or they are in a postdoctoral program training to become a practitioner in the area of psychology and the law.</p>
<p>Preference will be given to psychologists at any level who do not have or have limited institutional support to attend conferences, such as private practitioners or practitioners in public non-academic institutions. Special preference may be given to practicing psychologists who are presenting at the conference and have not previously been granted the grant. The funds shall be used for travel costs associated with attending the AP-LS conference exclusively.</p></li>
<li><p>Degree of support:</p>
<p>The maximum amount of support provided by the grant will vary depending on the amount of support needed or requested. It will also depend on the applicant’s stage of career:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Post-doctoral applicants may apply for a $600 maximum amount of support.</p></li>
<li><p>Early-career applicants may apply for a $500 maximum amount of support.</p></li>
<li><p>Mid to Advanced Career applicants may apply for a $400 maximum amount of support.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Application Process:</p></li>
</ol>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>A workshop on leadership on the Wednesday prior to the AP-LS conference</p></li>
<li><p>Webinars on leadership topics that may be eligible for CE credit (~1 per month)</p></li>
<li><p>Connecting participants to a mentor already in leadership in the Division</p></li>
<li><p>Providing opportunities for leadership within the Division by completing an initiative with AP-LS leadership</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Applicants are welcome from all career levels, including applicants who are students, ECPs, mid-career, and beyond.</p>
<p>To apply, please fill out the Qualtrics survey linked here (https://scrippscollege.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6usN0qp8SBVbSe2), where you will upload your CV and statement of interest. The statement of interest should provide a brief summary (up to 500 words) of where you are in your career, what interests you about leadership development, what leadership roles you have had, and what (if any) leadership roles you would like to obtain in the future.</p>
<p>Applications are due November 1, 2023.</p>
<p>**Note: As part of the application process, some basic demographic information will be collected through the Qualtrics survey that can be used to track applicants and participants as part of the evaluation of the program. It will help us determine who applies and who is accepted.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="call-for-book-proposals">Call for Book Proposals</h3>
<p>The American Psychology-Law Society invites proposals for new titles in its book series, which is now published by APA Books. We publish authored and edited volumes on current issues at the intersection of psychology and law. Books are typically a state of the science synthesis of a body of existing research with implications for practice and/or policy. Authors and editors should have a substantial and recent track record of publication and/or practice in psychology or law, and at least one should hold a doctorate in psychology or closely related behavioral science. If you have a proposal for a new book in the series or you would simply like more information, reach out to a member of the editorial team. We would be happy to tell you more.</p>
<p>The editorial board members are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Monica Miller, Division 41 Book Series Editor (mkmiller@unr.edu)</p></li>
<li><p>Monique Bowen, Division 41 Book Series Associate Editor (mbowen2@antioch.edu)</p></li>
<li><p>Jemour Maddux, Division 41 Book Series Associate Editor (jm@rule702.com)</p></li>
