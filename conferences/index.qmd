## {{< fa handshake-angle title="Volunteer" >}} Student Volunteers

Students are eligible to receive complimentary conference registration by volunteering to serve as staff during the annual conference.

**To apply:**

1.  Submit a letter of intent to serve on official letterhead from your program chair, department head, or faculty to {{< fa envelope title="Email" >}} {{< var email.office >}} that includes the following statement:

    | *"This letter of intent is made with the full understanding that \[insert student name here\] will volunteer as staff support for the AP-LS 2024 conference for which the registration scholarship has been awarded. Failure to serve will not only void the scholarship but will jeopardize future requests. Should I attend the conference and fail to serve, payment in full of applicable fees will be rendered to AP-LS upon request."*

2.  All Submissions are due **November 24th, 2023** and will be reviewed and accepted by **November 30th**. If you are accepted you will receive a discount code for registration. We highly recommend waiting to register until receiving this discount code as refunds can often take some time.



## {{< fa circle-info >}} For Presenters

### Symposia, Paper, and Data Blitz Sessions

Symposia sessions are 80 minutes long and paper and data blitz sessions are 60 minutes long. All sessions will have an assigned chair who will be responsible for ensuring that approximately 10 minutes are reserved for questions. The remaining time should be divided evenly across all the scheduled presenters.

::: {.callout-caution appearance="simple"}
While Audio/Visual should be available in session rooms, note that Internet will not be. Thus, presenters need to ensure that their A/V content is stored on their computer and thumb drive so that it can be transferred to the session room computer and played locally.
:::

### Posters

**Poster Sizing:** The poster boards for mounting a poster are 4 ft (height) x 8 ft (width). Presenters are free to print any size poster that will fit within this space. Pushpins will be provided.

**Poster Board Numbering:** Posters are numbered in the conference program so that the number for the poster indicates the correct board on which the poster should be hung. Poster presenters should refer to these numbers to identify the poster board to hang their poster.

## {{< fa plane >}} Plan your trip

For attendees flying in to Los Angeles, the LAX FlyAway runs from LAX to the Union Station train station in downtown LA and is \$10. The LAX FlyAway runs from LAX every 30 minutes and from Union Station every hour. Union Station is a short Uber or cab ride to the hotel but is a great option for individuals arriving alone as Ubers and cabs directly from the airport can be costly.
