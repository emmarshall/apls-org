## {{< fa handshake-angle title="Volunteer" >}} Student Volunteers

Students are eligible to receive complimentary conference registration by volunteering to serve as staff during the annual conference.

**To apply:**

1.  Submit a letter of intent to serve on official letterhead from your program chair, department head, or faculty to {{< fa envelope title="Email" >}} {{< var email.office >}} that includes the following statement:

    | *"This letter of intent is made with the full understanding that \[insert student name here\] will volunteer as staff support for the AP-LS 2024 conference for which the registration scholarship has been awarded. Failure to serve will not only void the scholarship but will jeopardize future requests. Should I attend the conference and fail to serve, payment in full of applicable fees will be rendered to AP-LS upon request."*

2.  All Submissions are due **November 24th, 2023** and will be reviewed and accepted by **November 30th**. If you are accepted you will receive a discount code for registration. We highly recommend waiting to register until receiving this discount code as refunds can often take some time.



## {{< fa circle-info >}} For Presenters

### Symposia, Paper, and Data Blitz Sessions

**Symposium sessions** are 80 minutes long. Allow approximately 10 minutes for questions and comments from the audience. Divide the remaining time evenly between the presenters and the discussant. 

**Paper sessions** are 60 minutes long. Most sessions have four or five papers; therefore, each presenter should plan to have 10-12 minutes to present. This will allow time at the end for audience questions. A chair will be assigned to paper sessions and will make introductions, help keep time, as well as guide questions at the end of the session. 

**Data-Blitz sessions** are 60 minutes long. Data-blitz presenters have a maximum of 5 minutes each (3-5 slides), followed by approximately 10 minutes of questions from the audience at the end of the session. 

::: {.callout-caution}
All presentation rooms will be set up with a computer, screen, and projector. **Bring a flash drive** to download the presentation onto the computer, and do not count on the availability of the **internet** in presentation rooms. 
:::

### Poster Sessions

Poster sessions are scheduled from 6:30-8:00 pm on Friday and Saturday evenings. Presenters are scheduled for either Friday or Saturday night and will be given a number to correspond with the board where they should display their posters. 

**Poster Sizing:** The boards for mounting a poster are 4 ft (height) x 8 ft (width). Presenters are free to create any size poster that will fit within that space. Presenters will need to bring push pins to hang their posters; we do not provide push pins. 

::: {.callout-tip}
We encourage poster presenters to use a [Better Poster format](https://convention.apa.org/blog/rethinking-the-science-poster).

## {{< fa plane >}} Plan your trip

For attendees flying in to Los Angeles, the LAX FlyAway runs from LAX to the Union Station train station in downtown LA and is \$10. The LAX FlyAway runs from LAX every 30 minutes and from Union Station every hour. Union Station is a short Uber or cab ride to the hotel but is a great option for individuals arriving alone as Ubers and cabs directly from the airport can be costly.
