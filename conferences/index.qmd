::: session-description
We invite proposal submissions for the 2026 Annual Conference of AP-LS. We strongly encourage empirically based proposals, proposals that involve new and emerging topics within psychology and law, and proposals that incorporate historically marginalized or underrepresented populations. Proposals will be evaluated through a blind review process focused on intellectual merit, innovation, novelty, and integration of multiple aspects of the field.

**Special Consideration for Artificial Intelligence (AI) Submissions**

Special consideration will be given to proposals regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in psychology and law. AI is defined as technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, decision making, creativity, and autonomy. We are particularly interested in empirical studies addressing machine models, deep learning models, and large learning models (LLMs).

## Proposal Types & Submission Requirements

[Proposal Types & Submission Requirements]{.plenary}

::: callout-note
Submission requirements have been modified to be more convenient. Specifically, the 1,000-word summary requirement has been omitted for all submissions, except Symposia. In lieu of this, the word count for abstracts is a slightly larger (i.e., 400-500 words).
:::

::: vspace
:::

[Symposia]{.plenary}

::: session-description
**Symposia:** A 60-to-80-minute session with multiple presentations (i.e., papers) focused on a single topic. This includes an independent discussant/chair and a minimum of 3 papers and no more than 5 papers. 
:::

[Papers]{.plenary}

::: session-description
**Papers:** A paper is a presentation describing an individual research topic or piece of legal scholarship. Accepted papers are clustered into 60-minute sessions, with 3-4 papers in each session. Whenever possible, papers are organized into themed sessions. 
:::

[Data-blitz]{.plenary}

::: session-description
**Data-blitz:** A data-blitz is face-paced, 5-minute presentation (limited to 3 PowerPoint slides) covering a bite-sized piece of emerging psycho-legal research. Accepted proposals are clustered into 60-minute sessions, with approximately 10 data-blitz es in each session. Whenever possible, data-blitzes are loosely organized by topic.<br>
:::

[Posters]{.plenary}

::: session-description
**Posters:** A poster is a concise, visual summary of research or legal scholarship that is displayed on a large poster board (e.g., 4’ x 6’). Accepted posters are presented during one of two evening poster sessions, typically Friday and Saturday evening, during the conference. They are not organized by topic. While not required, we encourage presenters to adhere to the [APA Convention Poster Instructions](https://convention.apa.org/presenters/posters), including the use of the [Better Poster format](https://convention.apa.org/blog/rethinking-the-science-poster).
