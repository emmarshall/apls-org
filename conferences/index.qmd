::: session-description
We invite proposal submissions for the 2026 Annual Conference of AP-LS. We strongly encourage empirically based proposals, proposals that involve new and emerging topics within psychology and law, and proposals that incorporate historically marginalized or underrepresented populations. Proposals will be evaluated through a blind review process focused on intellectual merit, innovation, novelty, and integration of multiple aspects of the field.

**Special Consideration for Artificial Intelligence (AI) Submissions**

Special consideration will be given to proposals regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in psychology and law. AI is defined as technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, decision making, creativity, and autonomy. We are particularly interested in empirical studies addressing machine models, deep learning models, and large learning models (LLMs).

[Call for AP-LS Pre-Conference Workshop Proposals]{.plenary}

::: vspace
:::

The AP-LS Continuing Education (CE) Committee is accepting proposals for pre-conference workshops at the AP-LS Annual Conference in Reno, Nevada. These workshops are scheduled to take place the day before the general conference programming begins: on Wednesday, March 11, 2026. We are seeking workshop proposals for innovative and cutting-edge topics and ask presenters to briefly describe how their proposed workshop promotes equity, inclusion, and justice in psychology and law.

We are particularly eager to receive proposals on the topics listed below. However, we encourage submissions on any aspect of psychology and law. Even if your proposal idea doesn't align with these specific topics, we still invite you to submit a proposal!

::: callout-tip
## Innovative and cutting edge topics

{{< fa circle-right aria-hidden="true" >}} Telepractice (at an intermediate level) </br> {{< fa circle-right aria-hidden="true" >}} Working in large institutional settings <br> {{< fa circle-right aria-hidden="true" >}} Grants (e.g., applying for and receiving) <br> {{< fa circle-right aria-hidden="true" >}} Statistics (e.g., in reference to peer-reviewing and examining qualitative data) <br> {{< fa circle-right aria-hidden="true" >}} Al and forensic psychology <br> {{< fa circle-right aria-hidden="true" >}} Career training for early-career scholars and clinicians <br> {{< fa circle-right aria-hidden="true" >}} Career training for mid-career scholars and clinicians <br> {{< fa circle-right aria-hidden="true" >}} Working with aging forensic populations (e.g., individuals with dementia)
:::

Workshop presenters will receive an honorarium commensurate with the workshop length (1.e., half-day or full-day). **Proposals are due by 11:59 PM PDT, October 15, 2025,** and can be submitted [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScCMpSZYxr6JKElDfZIGK8DQHUJ3bgt0CYmfRm5mcmVxrsBYQ/viewform?usp=send_form). Contact Sara Millspaugh, Ph.D., at `ce@ap-ls.org` with any questions.

**Please note:** The pre-conference workshops are separate from general AP-LS conference programming (e.g., separate application portals and review processes). Therefore, you are welcome to submit proposals to both the CE Committee for a preconference workshop and to the AP-LS Conference Chairs for general conference programming from March 12th to 14th, 2026.

We look forward to receiving your pre-conference workshop proposals!
