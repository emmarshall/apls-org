## {{< fa bullhorn >}} 2024 Call for Proposals

### APLS 2024 Call for Proposals

We invite proposal submissions for the 2024 Annual Conference of AP-LS. We strongly encourage proposals that are empirically based and that involve new and emerging topics within psychology and law, as well as proposals that include diverse populations. We also welcome legal proposals that can be offered for Continuing Legal Education credit. Proposals will be evaluated through a blind review process focused on intellectual merit, innovation, novelty, and integration of multiple aspects of the field.

::: simple-info
### Visit the conference website to register, submit your proposals, AND sign up as a reviewer!

[Sign up](https://ap-ls2024.exordo.com/){.btn-action-primary .btn-action .btn .btn-primary role="button"}

##### All proposals must be submitted by ~~Monday, October 2, 2023~~ [the extended deadline of extended deadline of Monday, October 9, 2023 at]{style="color: red;"} 11:59 pm PST 
:::

**Posters:** Posters will be presented at one of two poster sessions typically held Friday and Saturday evenings. Poster presentations are made in written format on display boards (size TBA). Submissions are limited to a 100-word abstract and 1000-word summary.

**Data-blitz:** A 5-minute presentation (limit 3 slides), covering a bite-sized piece of psycho-legal research. Submissions are limited to a 100-word abstract, 1000-word summary, and 1-2 learning objectives. The sessions will offer a fast-paced overview of the most exciting research emerging in psychology and law. Data-blitz sessions will include top-rated papers and will not be organized by topic (great for research and legal scholarship that does not traditionally fit with other AP-LS sessions!). Authors will indicate whether they would like to be considered as a paper and data-blitz, only for a paper, or only as a data-blitz.

**Papers:** Presentation of a paper describing an individual research topic OR piece of legal scholarship. Submissions are limited to a 100-word abstract, 1000-word summary, and 1-2 learning objectives. After acceptances/rejections are completed, 3-5 paper presentations will be grouped into 60- or 80-minute sessions.

**Symposia:** A coordinated group of presentations with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 5 presentations, as well as an independent discussant. Symposia will be scheduled as 80-minute sessions. The participation of each presenter must be secured before submission.

*Note that due to current limitations of the Ex Ordo submission portal, there are several symposia-specific submission instructions that MUST be followed to ensure it is appropriately reviewed.*

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Please read the following instructions carefully.

Symposia chairs will be expected to complete a submission for the full symposium, as well as for each paper to be included in the symposium (i.e., chairs should be completing 4 to 6 submissions).

The full symposium submission will include the name and title for the symposium chair (listed first) as well as the name and title for the discussant (listed second). The symposium title must be preceded by a unique 4-digit numeric code (e.g., the last 4 digits of the chair's office phone). The symposium submission will also include a 100-word abstract, but in lieu of the 1000-word summary, symposia chair should submit 3-5 learning objectives for the symposia session and a minimum of 5 APA-formatted references (published in the last 10 years). Additionally, please identify the type of CE credit (e.g., program content focused on assessment/intervention, ethical/legal guidelines, or other practice, education, or research) and provide a brief description (\< 100 words) on how the offered content conforms to that CE presentation type. Finally, the discussant's CV will need to be uploaded to the submission portal.

Each paper to be included in the symposium session should also be submitted by the symposium chairs. The submission should be identified as a symposium, but otherwise, will follow similar requirements as paper submissions. The exception being that the presenting author's CV will need to be submitted with each paper. In addition, the title of the paper should include the same 4-digit numeric code as the symposium title. It should also include a Paper \# to ensure the symposium is reviewed in the correct order.

The full symposium proposal title would be submitted as:

\#### - Title of Symposium {{< fa arrow-right >}} 3975 -- Using an interactive simulation of legal procedures to study plea decision-making

The papers would then be submitted as: \#### - Paper 1 -- Title of Paper 1 {{< fa arrow-right >}} 3975 -- Paper 1 -- How to customize your own interactive simulation of legal procedures

\#### - Paper 2 -- Title of Paper 2 {{< fa arrow-right >}}

3975 -- Paper 2 -- Guilt status influences plea outcomes beyond the shadow of the trial

\#### - Paper 3 -- Title of Paper 3 {{< fa arrow-right >}}

3975 -- Paper 3 -- "Reject the offer": the asymmetric impact of defense attorneys' plea recommendations

\#### - Paper 4 -- Title of Paper 4 {{< fa arrow-right >}}

3975 -- Paper 4 -- Terms and conditions apply: The effect of probation details and duration on true and false guilty pleas
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
Please note there is a limit of TWO first-author symposia/paper/data-blitz submissions per person. There are no limits for the number of submissions for posters or appearances as a discussant or session chair.

##### **If you are an author on more than one submission, please use the same email address for each submission to avoid duplicate profiles.**
:::

**Reviewers:** Reviewers are invited for all content areas including both professional and graduate student reviewers. Proposals for review will be distributed by mid-October. Please sign up to be a reviewer using the submission portal when you submit your proposal, or, if you do not plan to submit a proposal, [using this Google form](https://forms.gle/dNDx2AtUU5tcb3oG8).

Please visit the AP-LS webpage for continuing conference-related updates.
