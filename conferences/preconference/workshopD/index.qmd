description: |
  The American Psychological Association (APA) has emphasized the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion in their strategic plan with a specific focus on diverse and inclusive curriculum. Specifically, at the undergraduate level, the APA (2013) issued the Guidelines for the Undergraduate Psychology Major which highlighted efforts to integrate diversity into courses; at the graduate level, the APA Commission on Accreditation (2015) requires programs to facilitate a supportive learning environment for diverse learners. Despite these recommendations, faculty receive limited support regarding how to accomplish these goals. 
  In this interactive workshop, we offer a comprehensive exploration of the challenges, benefits, principles, and strategies necessary to design and teach a psychology and law course that is grounded in equity, diversity, and inclusion. By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to design a syllabus, facilitate discussions and activities, and develop assessments that are relevant to psychology and law and align with the Universal Design for Learning principles.   
objectives:
  - Apply Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles to create and revise course materials.
  - Identify teaching strategies for fostering an inclusive classroom environment that promotes respectful engagement and discussion.
  - Examine inclusive and equitable assessments that measure diverse students’ understanding of course content.
  - Identify resources and tools that support instructors in EDI-focused course design.
