description: |
  "The U.S. Military enforces a Uniformed Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) that has several parallels to federal law as well as multiple points of deviation.  Consistent with federal law, service members are assumed competent to stand trial and mentally responsible unless evaluated and demonstrated to be lacking in one or both of these domains.  The paucity of forensically training military psychologists leaves a critical gap in the support of the military justice system and generates a need and opportunity for non-military forensic psychologists to develop competence in this domain.  This workshop will review the history of the UCMJ, relevant case law, reporting requirements, and cultural factors necessary to competently conduct these evaluations."
