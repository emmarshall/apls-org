    "text": "One goal of AP-LS is promoting the education of psychologists in matters of law and the education of legal personnel in matters of psychology. Information about pursuing a career in psychology and law can be found here. You can also learn more about the field through our interviews with professionals’ series. This page summarizes our ongoing educational activities.\n\n\nThere are over 50 doctoral and master’s programs that teach a combination of psychology and law. Information about, and links to, these programs can be found on the page about graduate programs.\nMembers of the Teaching, Training, and Careers Committee (TTC) developed a guide to assist students interested in psychology and law graduate programs.The Resource Directory of Forensic Psychology Predoctoral Internships Training Programs includes a listing of predoctoral internships offering training opportunities in forensic psychology.The Education and Training Guidelines (PDF, 52KB), developed by the Forensic Specialty Council of the Council of Specialties in Professional Psychology, outline the required elements of an organized, sequential training program in forensic psychology, including postdoctoral residency training.\n\n\n\nBest Undergraduate Paper: The AP-LS Award for Best Undergraduate Paper is awarded to an outstanding undergraduate research paper that is focused on the interdisciplinary study of psychology and law. Dissertation Award: The American Psychology-Law Society confers Dissertation Awards for scientific research and scholarship that is relevant to the promotion of the interdisciplinary study of psychology and law. Students who complete dissertations involving basic or applied research in psychology and law, including its application to public policy, are encouraged to apply for these awards. Saleem Shah Award: The Saleem Shah Award is co-sponsored by the American Psychology-Law Society (APA Division 41) and the American Academy of Forensic Psychology. The award is for early career excellence and contributions to the field of psychology and law. The focus on the nominee’s contributions may be in any area of forensic practice, research, or public policy.\n\n\n\nSyllabus Collection: The AP-LS Teaching, Training, and Careers Committee is continuing its efforts to collect syllabi for courses in Psychology and Law or closely related topics. You may download any of the collected syllabi for undergraduate or graduate courses.”Activities for Teaching Psychology and Law: A Guide for Instructors” by Zelechoski, Wolbransky, and Riggs Romaine, offers a wide variety of such activities for courses in psychology and law. The activities incorporate individual and group work, videos, reading materials, classroom discussions, homework assignments, and lots of interactive exercises.Teaching Materials for Undergraduate Legal Psychology Courses: Dr. Edie Greene and Erica Drew have collected information intended for instructors of undergraduate courses in psychology and law. Download “Resources for Teaching Undergraduate Psychology and Law Courses” (PDF, 416KB) View list of other available resources for those teaching courses in psychology and law.\nGrants and Funding AP-LS Grants in Aid: The Division 41 Grants-in-Aid Committee considers proposals for small grants (maximum of $750) to support empirical graduate research that addresses psycholegal issues. The award is limited to graduate students who are student affiliate members of AP-LS. The Diversity in Psychology and Law Research Awards support undergraduate and graduate research on issues related to psychology, law, multiculturalism and/or diversity (i.e., research pertaining to psycholegal issues on race, gender, culture, sexual orientation, etc.)."

    "text": "Overview\nThis engaging panel on Law & Psychology includes an overview of the field and presents six psychologists who conduct research and practice at the intersection of psychology and the law. Panelists use their background in psychology to educate attorneys, judges, and juries on the role of psychology to reduce bias, increase cooperation, ensure procedural fairness, and understand psychological evidence including eyewitness testimony. Clinical forensic psychologists conduct evaluations of harm, risk, and abilities such as competency to stand trial or criminal responsibility in family, civil, sentencing, and criminal cases; they may work with survivors of violence as well as offenders to ensure public safety, reduce recidivism, and prevent offenses. Panelists provide guidance about graduate education and deciding on a career in psychology and law."

Recruit them into AP-LS’s AP program.\nApply Here\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Description\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        The purpose of the Access Path to Psychology and Law Experience (AP) Program is to increase diversity within psychology and law by increasing the pipeline of competitive graduate school applicants from groups that currently are underrepresented in the field, including racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and disabled students. AP is designed to encourage faculty members to recruit students from underrepresented groups into their research labs. It provides financial support for the students to obtain meaningful research experience and attend the AP-LS conference as well as other opportunities for mentoring and development. It is the intention of the BRIDGE Committee that many of the students in the AP program will apply for graduate training related to psychology and law and ultimately become professionals in the field. The AP program primarily targets undergraduate students, but students from terminal master’s degree programs will also be considered. \n         Program requirements\n           Students in the AP program are required to:\n      \n work on research for approximately 10 hours per week for the duration of their research experience;\n participate in GRE classes and/or other development opportunities;\n attend an AP-LS conference;\n submit a proposal to present their research at an AP-LS conference or in the Div. 41 program of an APA conference;\n submit a summary of their research experience to the BRIDGE chair within one month of its completion;\n correspond with a secondary mentor from the BRIDGE Committee;\n participate in the ongoing assessment of the AP program.\n\n Faculty mentors in the AP program are required to:\n\n closely supervise their students to ensure that they have a meaningful research experience that will make them more competitive for graduate school;\n help identify and facilitate opportunities for their students to participate in GRE classes and/or other development programs offered on their campuses (e.g., through the McNair program);\n assist their students in making a conference presentation about their research;\n participate in the ongoing assessment of the AP program.\n\n\n\nAward amounts \nThe AP program will award up to $3,000 per student, depending on the length of the research experience. Recipients will be given a stipend of $1,200 per semester or $800 per quarter or summer for up to one year. In addition, they will receive $100 for research expenses and up to $500 to attend the AP-LS conference. Six awards of $3,000 (i.e., for year-long experiences) or a larger number of smaller awards (i.e., for part-year experiences) will be given.\n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        Eligibility\n      \n    \n    \n      \n      To receive an award:\n      \n      Faculty are encouraged to identify promising undergraduate and terminal master's degree students from underrepresented groups who are interested in psychology and law and have the potential to become competitive graduate applicants. \n       Underrepresented groups include, but are not limited to, racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and physically disabled students. \n             Because the AP program is intended to expand the pipeline of qualified students from underrepresented groups, students should not be working with the faculty member in the proposed capacity prior to initiating the application process. \n       Students may already be working in the lab of a professor, but the proposal must consist of a new project. \n       Students in the AP program should be supervised primarily by faculty members rather than by graduate students. \n \nNote that applicants will only be eligible to receive one BRIDGE award per funding year.\n \n    \n  \n  \n    \n\n  \n    \n      \n        How to Apply\n      \n    \n    \n      \n    Applications will be awarded on a competitive basis and selected based on the quality of the proposed research and mentoring experience as well as the potential for the student to become a successful graduate applicant. All proposals will be reviewed by members of the BRIDGE Committee.\n     Award applications should contain the following:\n        \n       cover letter that provides contact information for both the student and the mentor  \n        a one- to two-page personal statement written by the student that addresses the following issues: \n      \n          student's interest in the field of psychology and law, either in general or with respect to a particular issue in the field  \n\n         student's educational and career goals\n  \n\n         student's current qualifications and experiences for achieving those goals. All students should provide their current overall and psychology-specific GPAs  \n         \n          students also may discuss any personal characteristics or life experiences that are relevant to proposed project\n  \n\n a two- to three-page description of the proposed research experience\n \n        \nStudents should discuss the research activities they will engage in with their mentors. \nPlease describe the topic of the proposed research, providing as much detail about the project as well as the specific research tasks in which the student will engage. It is not necessary for students to complete an independent project, but they need to obtain meaningful experience that will help them be competitive for graduate school.\n \n   \n       \n The research proposal should include the following, to the extent possible: \n  \n        \n         brief introduction/background to the project \n brief description of the method, including participants, measures, and procedures \n\n\n letter of support from the faculty member discussing the applicant's potential for graduate work, interest in psychology and law, and ability to complete the proposed research experience. In addition, the faculty member should discuss his or her anticipated strategy for mentoring the student (e.g., amount of contact, training methods, plans for monitoring progress).\n\n  completed W-9 (U.S. citizen) or W-8 (noncitizen) tax form\n\n         \nApplicant responsibilities \nAward recipients will need to maintain financial receipts for all project expenses. They also are required to submit a project summary to the BRIDGE co-chairs within one month of the project completion date.\n\n Submission instructions and deadline\nAward submissions will be accepted starting September 15, 2022, through January 15, 2023.

    "text": "To recognize the substantive contributions of clinical mentors who educate and support emerging clinicians in psychology and the law with a lens toward the elimination of REC disparities, and social justice.\nApply Here\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Description\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        REC disparities in the criminal justice system (CJS) necessitate that practicing psychologists working in the field of psychology and the law use their knowledge and experience to combat them. Practitioners are in a unique position to offer education, assessment, intervention and advocacy on issues of REC disparities, racism, and discrimination in the field of psychology and the law. However, a limited body of research, lack of practice guidelines on REC integration in forensic practice, and low representation of Black, Indigenous, People Of Color (BIPOC) professionals, limit such efforts. Mentorship of emerging practitioners in psychology and the law on such issues can bridge the gap of knowledge, application, and BIPOC representation in the field. \n         The AP-LS Practice Committee wants to recognize the substantive contributions of practitioner mentors who educate and support emerging clinicians in psychology and the law with a lens toward the elimination of REC disparities and social justice. For these purposes, we use Goldstein’s (2007) definition of the practice of psychology and the law: “The application of psychological research, theory, practice, and traditional and specialized methodology (e.g. interviewing, psychological testing, forensic assessment, and forensically relevant instruments) to provide information relevant to a legal question.”\n         The award for Outstanding Practitioner Mentoring to Eliminate Racial, Ethnic and Cultural (REC) Disparities in the Field of Psychology and the Law, will be conferred on a yearly basis. The recipient will receive a $500 cash award, a plaque to be presented at the annual AP-LS conference, and will be featured in an AP-LS newsletter article, written by the practice committee, highlighting the recipient’s achievements and recommendations to other practitioners. Highlighting the recipient's mentorship practices and experiences can serve as a model for other professionals in the field of psychology and the law.\n        \nReferences\n Goldstein, A.M. (2007).

To be eligible for the award, individuals must have a doctoral degree (PhD, PsyD, EdD), self-identify as a predominantly practicing forensic psychologist (about 75% of their work) and have a track record of excellence conducting mentorship of emerging forensic practitioners. Namely, the mentorship of graduate students, postdoctoral trainees, or early career professionals preparing for a career in direct service provision.\n\n\n             The mentorship can be formal (e.g. an assigned clinical supervisor or mentor in a training program or place of work). It can also be so-called “informal mentorship” where the mentor has dedicated their personal time to assist and support emerging clinicians outside formal institutional affiliations (e.g. an African American forensic psychologist who regularly mentors other BIPOC early career psychologists in their area). Excellence in mentorship can take many shapes and forms. A common thread would be mentoring emerging clinicians, regardless of race or ethnicity, on using their specialized skills and knowledge as forensic psychologists to reduce REC disparities. The practitioner’s mentorship has had a significant impact in the system in which they operate (e.g. supporting increased training opportunities on BIPOC issues, helping increase BIPOC representation in the field of psychology and the law, supporting antiracist professional identities for emerging forensic psychologists).\n\n\n\n \n    \n  \n  \n    \n\n  \n    \n      \n        How to Apply\n      \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      The nomination package should be converted into a PDF file and emailed directly to the chair of the award committee.

It should also include their goals and accomplishments associated with the field of psychology and the law.\n       A curriculum vitae. \n        A letter of support from a mentee (e.g. former or current) focusing on the impact the individual had in their professional development and understanding of BIPOC issues in FMH.\n       \n \n      \n    Nomination packages are due January 15 and should be emailed to the chair of the award subcommittee. \n\n        To be awarded  \n     Recipients will receive a $500 cash award, a plaque to be presented at the annual AP-LS conference, and a feature article written by the practice committee members in the practice committee section of the AP-LS newsletter highlighting the recipients’ achievements and recommendations.\n\n \n                    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n Contact Us\nAP-LS Practice Committeeaward.practice.apls@gmail.com"

    "title": "Saleem Shah Early Career Award",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Recognizes early career excellence and contributions to the field of psychology and law with a focus on forensic practice, research, or public policy.\nCo-sponsored by American Academy of Forensic Psychology.\n\n\n    \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Background\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Saleem A. Shah, who was internationally known for his leadership in the field of law and mental health, died on Nov. 25, 1992, from injuries suffered when his automobile was struck by a drunken driver. Saleem was born on December 2, 1931, in Allahabad, India. After receiving a BA from Allahabad University, he came to the United States on a fellowship and earned his PhD in clinical psychology at Pennsylvania State University in 1957. He served as a graduate psychology intern at Spring Grove State Hospital, outside Baltimore, where he met his wife, Terry, with whom he had six daughters, all of whom survive him. After leaving Penn State, Saleem joined the Legal Psychiatric Services Division of the Department of Public Health in Washington, DC. He rose quickly to the post of chief psychologist and held this position until he joined the staff of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in 1966.\n\nSaleem remained at NIMH for the rest of his professional life. From 1968 to 1987, he was the chief of an extramural research program originally known as the Center for Studies of Crime and Delinquency and later as the Antisocial and Violent Behavior Branch. The scope of this program was extremely broad, covering such issues as the biology of antisocial behavior, delinquency, violence, and law and mental health studies. Saleem's mastery of this entire interdisciplinary program soon made him a legend inside and outside NIMH, but his greatest interest was always the field of law and mental health, which he saw as encompassing the full range of interactions between the legal and mental health systems (see Law and Mental Health: Major Developments and Research Needs, 1991, with Bruce Sales).\n\nSaleem's personal contributions to his field can perhaps be summed up as follows. He was committed, first and foremost, to the goal of achieving fair and equitable treatment for mentally disordered offenders and other persons whose mental status was at issue before the law. In his numerous scientific publications, he repeatedly drew attention to the tension between the therapeutic and the social control objectives of mental health laws and to the need for careful analysis of underlying constructs to establish a clear ethical and legal basis for policies and programs. As his writings on these topics became widely known, he was increasingly asked to give lectures and consultations in other countries, such as Germany, the former Soviet Union, and China.\n\nWhat Saleem could not do on his own, he accomplished through others. In 1968 he established law and mental health studies as a formal program priority for NIMH and became the guide and mentor for a new generation of scholars who by their empirical and theoretical work, much of it supported by NIMH, transformed the field of law and mental health studies: Thomas Grisso, John Monahan, Loren Roth, Bruce Sales, Henry Steadman, Linda Teplin, and David Wexler, to name but a few. Saleem also initiated an NIMH monograph series for the purpose of making current knowledge and research findings in law and mental health more readily available to policymakers and other potential users. More than 20 volumes were published during Saleem's lifetime on topics such as clinical prediction of violent behavior, competency to stand trial, mental health services in local jails, and clinical treatment of violent persons.\n\nSaleem received many honors. He was the first recipient of the American Psychology-Law Society Award for Distinguished Contributions to Psychology and Law; he also received the Isaac Ray Award of the American Psychiatric Association for outstanding contributions in law and mental health and six U.S. government awards.\n\nSaleem’s Rules\nAt the 2012 AP-LS Conference there was a session titled \"Saleem’s Rules: Lessons in Mentoring, Knowing What’s Right, and Changing the World - Why AP-LS Created a Saleem Shah Award\" with speakers Thomas Grisso, Henry J. Steadman, Edward Mulvey and John Monahan. Dr. Grisso wrote an article (PDF, 28KB)[insert link to pdf here] about that panel's discussions for the summer 2012 AP-LS News newsletter.\n\n\n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        Description\n      \n    \n    \n      \n       \n    \n  \n  The Saleem Shah Award is an annual award co-sponsored by the American Academy of Forensic Psychology and the American Psychology-Law Society recognizing early career excellence and exceptional contributions to the field of psychology and law.

    "text": "Apply Here\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Description\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        The intent of this grant initiative is to advance a more interdisciplinary science that addresses understudied topics in psychology and law, as well as to broaden the discipline and amplify its practical impact. Proposed projects must investigate new or understudied topics in psychology and law, enhance the diversification of psychology and law research through novel theoretical or methodological approaches that are cross-disciplinary in nature, and/or promote the impact of research by considering novel populations or new problems or processes within the legal system. The proposed project is to include collaboration with practitioners or policymakers. Successful proposals are expected to involve projects with the potential to transform and impact the field by furthering novel lines of research inquiry and/or facilitating new cross-disciplinary collaborations. \nAward amounts\nProposals may be submitted to one of two funding categories: small/seed proposals ($1,000-$5,000 for a 12-month research period) and large proposals ($15,000-$50,000 over a 12- to 18-month research period).\n Funding should primarily support research activities and data collection efforts. Support for research assistants and necessary travel may be requested, but should not constitute the majority of the requested funds. No funds can be used to support the salary of the principal investigator (PI) or co-PI. Funds for successful proposals will be awarded to the PI’s academic institution (via the institution’s Office of Sponsored Research or Foundation). No institutional indirect cost recovery will be permitted, and proposals submitted for consideration by this program must not be submitted for consideration by other grant programs (including AP-LS programs). Proposals submitted but not funded in previous funding cycles may be resubmitted, but all proposals will be evaluated as new proposals. \nResearchers may submit a maximum of one proposal to the large grant mechanism and one proposal to the small grant mechanism. That is, researchers can be an author or co-author on a maximum of one proposal to each of the grant categories. Students may not be PIs on proposals, although they may be co-PIs. \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Eligibility\n      \n    \n    \n      \nApplicants may submit only one small and one large proposal per funding cycle. A student cannot be a sole PI on any submission but are allowed to be a co-PI on a submission. At least one of the co-PIs needs to be an AP-LS member.\n \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        How to Apply\n      \n    \n    \n      \n      \n        The pre-proposal process\n    Interested researchers should submit a 1,000-word prospectus to the committee by October 15 at 11:59 p.m. PST.  All materials are submitted through the Div. 41 (AP-LS) awards page. \n     The prospectus should include four sections: \n        \n       Describe the project in no more than 500 words.  \n        Describe how the project contributes to the research initiative in no more than 500 words (See review criteria outlined below).  \n         A reference list (Does not count toward the word limit).  \n          A 150-word abstract describing the proposed research;  \n           Suggestions for three proposal reviewers. Suggested reviewers should not include anyone who might have a significant conflict of interest in reviewing the proposal (defined under full proposal “significant collaborators”).

    "text": "AP-LS is an interdisciplinary organization devoted to scholarship, practice, and public service in psychology and law. The American Psychology-Law Society is both a free-standing organization as well as a division (Division 41) of the American Psychological Association. Members of AP-LS need not be members of APA, although many members belong to both organizations (AP-LS and APA). Membership is open to interested professionals and students in other disciplines beyond psychology. Membership is for the calendar year January 1 - December 31.\nMembership in AP-LS entitles one to online access of the journal, Law and Human Behavior and the American Psychology-Law Monthly E-News. AP-LS also sponsors an annual meeting as well as programs at the APA convention. The activities of AP-LS/Division 41 in its brief history have been quite diverse, including developing a collection of course syllabi and teaching materials, conducting a survey of career opportunities in psychology and law, studying special ethical problems in expert testimony, drafting recommendations, and sponsoring an annual conference."

Dues are $50.00.  Non-Psychologists (e.g., lawyers, sociologists) or psychologists who do not belong to APA may join as Members-at-Large by submitting a check for $50.00.

If you don’t meet this criteria, the Executive Committee of AP-LS will vote at the annual APA Convention to determine whether to waive this requirement if there is evidence satisfactory to the Executive Committee of contribution by an individual to the field of Psychology and Law.\n\n\nEarly Career Professionals\n$15.00 Per Year\n\n\nThose who received a doctoral degree (J.D., Ph.D., Psy.D., M.D., or Ed.D.) within the past 3 years, may join at an introductory rate in one of the membership categories for a reduced fee of $15.00.  Please make sure you fill out your graduation date (please indicate the 1st of the month if you do not remember the precise date).\n\n\n\n\nStudent Member\n\n\n$15.00 Per Year\n\n\nUndergraduate students, graduate students and law students may join as Associates-at-Large.
