    "text": "One goal of AP-LS is promoting the education of psychologists in matters of law and the education of legal personnel in matters of psychology. Information about pursuing a career in psychology and law can be found here. You can also learn more about the field through our interviews with professionals’ series. This page summarizes our ongoing educational activities.\n\n\nThere are over 50 doctoral and master’s programs that teach a combination of psychology and law. Information about, and links to, these programs can be found on the page about graduate programs.\nMembers of the Teaching, Training, and Careers Committee (TTC) developed a guide to assist students interested in psychology and law graduate programs.The Resource Directory of Forensic Psychology Predoctoral Internships Training Programs includes a listing of predoctoral internships offering training opportunities in forensic psychology.The Education and Training Guidelines (PDF, 52KB), developed by the Forensic Specialty Council of the Council of Specialties in Professional Psychology, outline the required elements of an organized, sequential training program in forensic psychology, including postdoctoral residency training.\n\n\n\nBest Undergraduate Paper: The AP-LS Award for Best Undergraduate Paper is awarded to an outstanding undergraduate research paper that is focused on the interdisciplinary study of psychology and law. Dissertation Award: The American Psychology-Law Society confers Dissertation Awards for scientific research and scholarship that is relevant to the promotion of the interdisciplinary study of psychology and law. Students who complete dissertations involving basic or applied research in psychology and law, including its application to public policy, are encouraged to apply for these awards. Saleem Shah Award: The Saleem Shah Award is co-sponsored by the American Psychology-Law Society (APA Division 41) and the American Academy of Forensic Psychology. The award is for early career excellence and contributions to the field of psychology and law. The focus on the nominee’s contributions may be in any area of forensic practice, research, or public policy.\n\n\n\nSyllabus Collection: The AP-LS Teaching, Training, and Careers Committee is continuing its efforts to collect syllabi for courses in Psychology and Law or closely related topics.

    "text": "The mission of the American Psychology-Law Society is to enhance well-being, justice, and human rights through the science and practice of psychology in legal contexts. We stand strongly against racism, prejudice, and hate in all its forms. The tragic deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade, and countless other Black, Indigenous, and People of Color are unacceptable. These instances of horrific violence once again illustrate the profound systemic inequities and injustices toward marginalized and oppressed communities in the United States and around the world broadly and more specifically in our criminal justice, civil justice, legal, and carceral systems.\nWe recognize that racism does not occur in isolation, and its effects are heightened for people who also experience discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, social class, religion, immigration status, and other identities. Likewise, the negative effects of racism multiply across contexts. Recently, racial/ethnic disparities related to COVID-19, health care access, and the spread of COVID-19 in criminal and juvenile justice systems have magnified these profound inequities and injustices.\nWe believe that, through research, education, and training, better policies and practices can be developed to make the criminal justice, civil justice, legal, and carceral systems more equitable, just, and responsive to the needs of the communities in which they work.\nAs AP-LS members, we must engage in dialogue and action to create change within our society, our educational and legal institutions, and in our communities. We must engage in stronger efforts that support equity, inclusion, and just outcomes through our research, practice, teaching, and other professional activities. As a society, we seek to join other organizations to promote justice, put a spotlight on injustice, and condemn racism in all its forms. We stand together with Black, Indigenous, and Communities of Color and other oppressed groups and recommit to working together to ensure justice for all."

    "text": "Statement in Response to the Atlanta-area March 2021 Deaths\n\nSoon after the tragedy involving the death of George Floyd, AP-LS issued a statement in solidarity and to entrench our strong stand against hate in all forms. In response to the senseless killings of eight individuals in the Atlanta, Georgia area, largely because of the intersectionality of their gender and Asian heritage, AP-LS issues a second statement. AP-LS is committed to finding ways to combat prejudice and discrimination through the research, teaching, and practice of psychological science and law. For further resources and to see the statement issued by the Asian American Psychological Association {{<\n\nThe mission of the American Psychology-Law Society is to enhance well-being, justice, and human rights through the science and practice of psychology in legal contexts. We stand strongly against misogyny, racism, prejudice, and hate in all forms. On March 16, 2021, eight individuals, including six women of Asian heritage, were senselessly gunned down in the larger Atlanta, Georgia area. Their names are:  Soon Chung Park, Hyun Jung Grant, Suncha Kim, Yong Ae Yue, Delaina Ashley Yaun, Paul Andre Michels, Xiaojie Tan, and Daoyou Feng. These tragic deaths and countless others because of skin color, gender, and background—and their intersection—are unacceptable. Instances of violence and hate against Asian and Asian American/Pacific Islanders (AAPI) in particular have been on the rise; according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, Anti-Asian hate crime rose 149% in 2020, despite a 7% decrease in hate crime overall. \nMarch 8, 2021, a mere eight days before the Atlanta-area killings, we celebrated International Women's Day. The theme of this year's International Women's Day was \"Choose to Challenge.\" That is, the theme was to make the choice to challenge and call out bias and inequality against women when we see it—and to raise your right hand in support and commitment.\nAs a society, AP-LS chooses to raise our right hand for the individuals killed on March 16, 2021, especially those targeted because of their intersectional identity as Asian women. We raise our right hand against all forms of bias, discrimination, prejudice, and inequality. We recognize that prejudice does not occur in isolation, and its effects are heightened for people who experience discrimination based on gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, social class, religion, immigration status, and other identities—and the intersection of these. As AP-LS members, we must engage in dialogue and action to create change within our society, our educational and legal institutions, and in our communities. We must speak out against hate, violence, and inequality whenever and wherever it occurs. We must continue to engage in stronger efforts that support equity, inclusion, and just outcomes through our research, practice, teaching, and other professional activities. We are committed to working together to ensure justice for all."

LAW AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR UPDATEMargaret Bull Kovera, Editor-in-ChiefAs 2017 draws to a close, so does my term as Editor-in-Chief of Law and Human Behavior.  With my term ending, I have been reflecting on the changes the journal has undergone during the time I have been a member of the leadership team at LHB, which includes seven years as Associate Editor and six as Editor-in-Chief.  Submissions to the journal have almost doubled. The number of Associate Editors has grown from three to four (and soon five) to keep pace with the growing submissions to the journal. We remain selective in our publication decisions, with rejection rates hovering around 80%.  However, the increasing number of submissions has allowed us to publish more high-quality content per issue, with articles published per issue increasing by almost 50% since I started as Editor-in-Chief. Our impact factor is now 2.822, the highest it has been in more than a decade; the five-year impact factor of 2.919 is the highest ever. I feel comfortable that our team is passing off a healthy journal to the new editorial team.During this time, we negotiated several new publishing contracts, including one that saw us move our production from Springer to the American Psychological Association.  Much in that move was positive, including increased page allotments, better marketing of the journal, and improved production services.  There were a few hiccups, most notably the loss of our placement in Westlaw and Lexis-Nexis during the transition. Although APA was able to negotiate our re-entry into Westlaw relatively rapidly, restoring the inclusion of our content in Lexis has proven to be more difficult. During my term, we have continued to push APA to resolve this issue and I am delighted to report that as of last week Lexis once again has agreed to publish our content, increasing our reach to legal professionals.  Contracts still need to be signed but I have been assured that the deal will be finalized before the end of the year.I have learned so much during my time at the journal, not only about research but about people. I am sure that I made mistakes.  I have tried to correct them when I realized that I had and ask for your forgiveness for those I did not notice. One decision that I am certain was not a mistake was the composition of my editorial team: Amy Bradfield Douglass, David DeMatteo, Bradley McAuliff, and Patricia Zapf. Their decisions were thoughtful and measured, improving the manuscripts that were published in the journal as well as those that eventually were published in other outlets. I am so grateful to them for making this job easier and for making me and the journal look good.It has been a great privilege to serve at the helm of our field’s journal.

Problem solving courts (PSCs) were developed in the late 1980s to address criminogenic risks and behaviors associated with law breaking, and now exist in the criminal, civil,and family court systems in many nations.This special issue will assemble rigorous experimental and quasi-experimental research to deepen our understanding of problem solving courts’ mechanisms and outcomes after almost thirty years of study. We invite empirical and theoretical articles, and systematic reviews of specialty courts as both systems reforms and discrete interventions. Preference will be given to empirical articles with data.For more information, please click here.The deadline for submission is July 31, 2018.AP-LS PRE-CONFERENCE WORKSHOPSFor information about the 2018 AP-LS Conference workshops, please click here. Please note that the early bird rates only apply until January 31, 2018.ON THE JOB OR POSTDOC MARKET? AP-LS JOB POSTINGSCheck out AP-LS's Job Postings Page for up-to-date information on available psychology-law positions here.Note that new positions are available.

In this month's Legal Update column, Dr. Emily Haney-Caron and Ms. Erika Diaz Ortiz discuss the implications of the recent reauthorization for clinicians, forensic evaluators, and researchers.To read this column, please click here. ON THE JOB OR POSTDOC MARKET? AP-LS JOB POSTINGSCheck out AP-LS's Job Postings Page for up-to-date information on available psychology-law positions here.Note that new positions are available.NEWSLETTER ARCHIVESArchives of the  newsletter are available at http://ap-ls.wildapricot.org/Newsletter.  bethcaillouet@gmail.com                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Newsletter Editorial Board  Editor Marc Patry marc.patry@smu.ca Associate Editor Leah Georges  leahgeorges@creighton.edu Student Assistant Editor Sarah Shaw sarah.shaw@smu.ca Content Editors -  Research Briefs Charles Stone &  Rebecca  Weiss  chstone@jjay.cuny.edu rweiss@jjay.cuny.edu Content Editor - Legal Update Christopher King  kingch@mail.montclair.edu Content Editor - Expert Opinion  Melinda Wolbransky melinda.wolbransky@gmail.com Content Editor - Teaching in Psych & Law Christina Riggs Romaine riggsromaine_christina@wheatoncollege.edu Content Editor - Advances in Psych &  Law Alice Thornewill & Shelby Arnold alice.thornewill@gmail.com shelby.a.arnold@gmail.com Content Editor - Career CornerKatherine Hazen aplsstudents@gmail.comMembership Services        AP-LS seeks to advance the science of psychology - law and the translation of psychology-law knowledge into practice and policy.  Our mission is to enhance well-being, justice, and human rights through science and practice of psychology in legal contexts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Copyright © American Psychology-Law Society                        Division 41 of the American Psychological Association All rights reserved.                   PO Box 805, Harrisburg, NC 28075Unsubscribe from E-NewsUnsubscribe from all APLS e-mails"

It seeks to highlight the unique contributions each group can make to the field of law-psychology. Each article will be co-authored by a student, a psychologist, and a legal professional in order to explore relevant issues from each perspective. In this first article, Jennifer Kamorowski, J.D., Heather Ellis Cucolo, J.D., & Allison D. Redlich, Ph.D. describe a new law, called \"International Megan's Law,\" requiring registered sex offenders to bear a \"unique identifier\" on their U.S. passports. The article poses 3 arguments for why the passport identifer is not justified.

I hope you are as excited as I am to see some great presentations, get involved in the Division, and catch up with friends and colleagues. As I’m sure you saw in your emails, the final program grid has been released. It can be found here. There are many exciting sessions offered! First, check out this year’s slate of pre-conference CE offerings. In keeping with my presidential initiative about expanding our research to address the needs of judges, the Presidential Plenary this year will be an “in conversation” with judges about their practice and research interests. There will be other fabulous special sessions offered by our hard-working committees that I want to highlight here. On Thursday, the Student Section will be offering a session titled “Bridging the Gap: Confinement in the Juvenile Justice System.” On Friday, the Research Committee will be offering a session discussing open science titled “Opening the Door for Better Science in Psychology and Law: The Benefits of Open Science Practices,” the Minority Affairs Committee will be offering “Preventing Wrongful Convictions & Bringing Innocent Clients Home,” and the Early Career Professionals Committee will present “Identifying & Meeting the Needs of Early Career Professionals in Law & Psychology.” On Saturday, the Teaching, Training, and Careers Committee will host “Influencing Change: The Varied Lives of Policy Work,” and the Professional Development of Women Committee will present “Terrified & Doing It Anyway: Embracing Your Inner Imposter.” Make sure you schedule time to check out some of the amazing work our committees are doing! All are invited to attend the Business Meeting on Thursday evening from 6-6:30, where you can learn about news in the Division and opportunities to get involved. Finally, don’t miss your chance to support the Student Section by participating in the 5k Fun Run!\n\n\n\nLEGAL UPDATE: RESOLUTION OR RESIGNATION: THE ROLE OF FORENSIC MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AMIDST THE COMPETENCY SERVICES CRISIS\n\nCompetency-related cases often occur in under-resourced, over-taxed systems of evaluation and care, despite the efforts of dedicated personnel found working in those systems. Forensic psychologists may have difficulty adhering to overarching ethical principles if our work occurs unabated in the midst of the inhumane conditions that often surround competency-related services. How should forensic professionals seek to resolve this challenge, if at all?\n\nTo read this column, please click here.\n\n\n\nPRE-CONFERENCE WORKSHOP CE AND CLE\n\nAP-LS has received approval to provide CLE to Louisiana Bar Association members in addition to CE for psychologists.

FINKELI regret to inform the Division that one of our distinguished members, Norman J. Finkel passed away last month on December 2, 2019. Norm Finkel spent most of his career in the Psychology Department at Georgetown University. He was on the faculty for thirty-seven years, beginning in 1970. He received his bachelor’s degree in Psychology from N.Y.U., where he studied with Phil Zimbardo, and his Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from Rochester University. At Georgetown, he taught Abnormal Psychology and Psychology and Law, as well as advanced seminars in Theories of Therapy, and Madness, Genius, and Creativity. In 2005, he received the College Dean’s Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching, reflecting his deep devotion to undergraduate students whom he taught with great dedication, flair, and with a particular focus on deepening students’ thinking and critical capacities. He was a leader in the field of psychology and law. During his career, he wrote many influential books in the field including Therapy and Ethics: The Courtship of Law and Psychology (1980), Mental Illness and Health (1982), Insanity on Trial (1988), Commonsense Justice: Jurors’ Notions of the Law (1995), Not Fair! The Typology of Commonsense Unfairness (2001), The Psychology of Rights and Duties: Empirical Contributions and Normative Commentaries (2005), and Emotions and Culpability: How the Law Is at Odds with Psychology, Jurors, and Itself (2006). He is survived by his daughter Jennifer, his sister Debbie, and countless friends and family, including his good friend Steve Sabat, Emeritus at Georgetown, who provided me with much of the information above from his own tribute to Norm for the department.\n\nThis is a great personal loss for me, as well as a loss for our field. I first met Norm as a student in his Theories of Therapy class at Georgetown. He was an exceptional teacher – funny, quirky, and engaging. There always was an element of theater in his teaching. If I’m being honest, I was an unexceptional student in that class. That was not our moment. In the fall of my senior year, I was still at a bit of a loss for what area of psychology interested me most. I knew I wanted to pursue something in the area of criminal psychology, but I wasn’t sure what or how. That’s when I took his Psychology and Law class, and it changed my life. Not only did it inspire me intellectually to pursue work in this field, but it also gave me a roadmap for how to teach more generally. In that class, there were so many “Jennifer”s (as is the curse of many people my age), that he gave us all nicknames. Mine was “44” because my middle name is Leigh, and Lee Grosscup (no relation to my knowledge) was an NFL Football player who I guess played with that number. At the very bottom of his syllabus for the class he encouraged anyone interested in doing research to contact him. I had never seen that before as a student. At the time, I had no idea what that really meant but I thought why not? I didn’t know going in what a prolific researcher he was or how important that experience would be for me. I worked with him my whole senior year, learning how to design studies, collect data, and most importantly, how to “think big” about the impact of psychology on the legal system.\n\nI continued to work with him for three years after graduation until I went to graduate and law school. He was a constant guiding force for me, providing me with opportunities, advice, and new knowledge. I know I would not be where I am today, in this field and in a career that I love, without his mentoring. Now, as a professor, I try to emulate his enthusiasm for learning and his openness and dedication to undergraduate research and education. I put a similar blurb at the bottom of the syllabus in every class I teach, inviting students to contact me if they are interested in research. I tell them this story. I have met and mentored some of the most amazing people because of this – because of him. I’m sure many of you have a “Norm” in your lives that sparked your interest in psychology and law. Take a minute to let them know, and never underestimate your own ability to light that spark for someone else.\n\nIn fond remembrance,\n\nJen Groscup (44)\n\nIf you would like to make a donation to honor his memory, the family has suggested the ACLU and the Holocaust Memorial in Washington DC as organizations with missions close to his heart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n    \n              \n            \n          \n      \n    \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n      \n    \n          \n            \n      \n        \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n      \n        \n            \n              \n                \n      LAW AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR UPDATE\n\nLora M. Levett, PhD\n\nAssociate Editor\n\nllevett@ufl.edu\n\nAnnouncing the 2020 Law and Human Behavior Reviewer Mentoring Program!\n\nHave you always wondered how people get to be reviewers for prestigious journals? Are you interested in becoming a reviewer for LHB (the official journal of AP-LS), but don’t know what that means or how to get training and experience with providing strong reviews? Do you have limited or no access to a mentor that can provide you with this type of experience? If so, now’s your chance to develop your reviewer skills!\n\nThe LHB editorial team is continuing their Reviewer Mentoring Program in 2020 to provide current graduate students and ECPs (within 10 years of last terminal degree) with training and mentoring specifically in conducting strong peer reviews. If you will be attending the AP-LS conference in March 2020 and do not have access to this type of mentoring in your current graduate program, we invite you to apply for the program.\n\nWe will be selecting a small pilot group of Reviewers to participate in a training workshop at the 2020 AP-LS conference and then matching those participants with Reviewer Mentors. Mentees will then be assigned several manuscripts to review throughout 2020, under the supervision and guidance of their Reviewer Mentor.\n\nIf you would like to be considered for this program, please complete the application at the following link by February 5 (https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LHBReviewing). \n\n\n\n2020 APA CONVENTION HIGHLIGHTS\n\nDivision 41 in D.C. \n\nAugust 6-9\n\nDivision 41 has developed an exciting program based on the numerous high-quality submissions received. Highlights include the discussion Want more forensic psychologists of color? Try listening, as well as the symposia Considerations for forensic evaluations with adults diagnosed with Intellectual Disabilities and Mass Shootings in America: A multi-method study of the past 50 years. Of note, APA at large is \"re-envisioning\" the Convention, which has been associated with a decrease in Division-specific programming hours. We received many more submissions than our allotted hours (15). This made for a very competitive process. Thank you to all reviewers who volunteered their time and expertise. See you in D.C.! \n\n\n\n5K FUN RUN!\n\nDon't forget to sign up for the Annual Student Committee 5k Fun Run before February 15, 2020! \n\nThe Annual 5K will be Friday, March 6, 2020 at 7:00 AM. Registration is $25.00 and includes a t-shirt as well as snacks after the race. All proceeds go to support the Student Committee activities. Sign up for the Fun Run here.\n\nThis year, we're going digital! When you register, you must also complete this waiver and upload it with your registration.\n\n\n\nREPRESENT AP-LS ON APA BOARDS AND COMMITTEES!\n\nOne great way for AP-LS members to make sure AP-LS' voice is heard within APA (and gain valuable leadership experience!) is to serve on APA boards and committees. To be eligible, you must be an APA member and apply through the APA Online Portal by March 6, 2020.

AP-LS 2018 CONFERENCE CALLMark your calendars, the 2018 AP-LS conference will be held March 8th - 10th, 2018! We are excited to host everyone at the grand Peabody Hotel in Memphis, Tennessee.Beginning September 1st, the submission site for the AP-LS 2018 conference Call for Proposals will be available at conferences.ap-ls.org. The deadline for submissions is September 29th, 2017. Here are some exciting new things to be aware of:The submission platform this year allows reviewers to register on the same site, so when you register for the site, consider signing up to review at the same time! We also encourage students to review proposals this year.Consider submitting a Psycho-legal Data-blitz! What is a data-blitz? A data blitz is a series of 5-minute talks (limit 3 slides), covering a bite-sized piece of psycho-legal research. The sessions will offer a fast-paced overview of the most exciting research emerging in psychology and law. Data-blitz sessions will include top-rated papers and will not be organized by topic (great for research and legal scholarship that does not traditionally fit with other AP-LS sessions!)If you have any questions, please contact the 2018 conference co-chairs Nicholas Druhn and Lindsey Wylie  REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS: $1,000 APF Weiss GrantThe American Psychological Foundation’s (APF) 2017 Drs.

The deadline for submission is June 1st, 2017. Guest Editors: Miko Wilford and Allison Redlich.  This special issue will assemble rigorous research and analytical articles that have the potential to deepen our understanding of guilty pleas (and related aspects) and/or influence policy and practice.

Preference will be given to empirical articles with data.

At one point, her kids shared a story about while growing up, they would go to events like the state fair and be one of the few families of color present. They would look at each other, smile, and say “Spot on a cow.” This is how they acknowledged that they were some of the few people of color at an event or outing. In this brief essay I will explain how being a spot on a cow led to my becoming a forensic psychologist and how it continues to shape the way I conceptualize and conduct forensic interviews.To read the column, please click here.RESEARCH BRIEFSTake a look at the latest research briefs for short summaries of the latest articles relevant to psychology-law. To read the research briefs, please click here.NEWSLETTER ARCHIVES  Archives of the  newsletter are available at http://ap-ls.wildapricot.org/Newsletter.

LHB IS GOING GREEN IN 2019In August 2017, the Division 41 Executive Committee unanimously voted to renew its lucrative contract with the American Psychological Association to publish Law and Human Behavior through 2023. One important change in the new contract is that AP-LS members will no longer receive a complimentary print subscription to the journal beginning with the first issue of Volume 43 in February 2019.To access current and past issues of LHB, AP-LS members should log into MyAPA using the email address they have on file with the division. All AP-LS members have a MyAPA account even if they are not members of the American Psychological Association.AP-LS members who wish to continue receiving a print subscription of LHB should contact APA directly. Details and prices can be found here under the Subscriptions Individuals button. ANNUAL AP-LS STUDENT COMMITTEE 5K FUN RUN!Don’t forget to register for the Annual Student Committee 5K Fun Run before February 15, 2019!This year the AP-LS Student Committee is also selling T-shirts to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the American Psychology-Law Society!For more information about the 5K Fun Run or the T-shirt sale, please click here.

PILOT GRANT PROGRAM WINNERS This year, we piloted a new grant program called the Funding Program to Enhance the Impact and Diversification of Psychology & Law Research.  The recipients of the grants are described below. Thanks to our Interdisciplinary and Research Grant committees for their innovative leadership, and to the reviewers who served on the review panels.AP-LS awarded one large grant ($42,446) and two small grants ($3,775 and $5,000) through this program.  Details of the projects funded via the large and small grants are below.Large Grant: Connecting Police Practitioners with Researchers: Developing a Law Enforcement Human-Subjects-PoolPI: Kimberly McClure, Western Illinois University Co-PI: Joanne Kurt-Hilditch, Illinois Law Enforcement Training and Standards Board Executive InstituteAbstract: We will establish the Professional Research Pool for Criminal Justice Science (PRP for CJS) directed and operated by the ILETSBEI. We will evaluate it as a mechanism to facilitate police researcher recruitment of representative, police samples, build a stronger partnership between executive law enforcement and researchers and improve the translation and acceptance of police research into policies and practices. This initial project will develop a web-based structure to connect criminal justice professionals and researchers. It will also lead to the development of an advisory board, procedural documents and curriculum development for the consumption and translation of scientific findings into practice and policy. Press release here.  Small Grant: When women conceive in rape: A mixed-methods study of legal experiences, outcomes, and preferencesPI: Lucy Guarnera, University of VirginiaCo-PI: N. Dickon Reppucci, University of VirginiaAbstract: When women conceive in rape, their pregnancy and any resulting birth put them in a unique legal position at the nexus of the criminal justice system and civil/family law system. Legal obstacles and negative perceptions regarding rape-related pregnancy may create serious problems for these doubly vulnerable victims, as well as making it more difficult to successfully prosecute these cases. Despite the significant number of rape-related pregnancies per year in the U.S. (an estimated 32,000) and the variety of laws and policies associated with rape-related pregnancy, no previous empirical research has investigated the legal trajectories of women who conceive in rape. And no empirical work has examined public preferences regarding the web of laws and policies that impact men, women, and children involved in alleged cases of rape-related pregnancy. We propose a two-phase, sequential exploratory mixed methods study to addresses these gaps in the literature.Small Grant: Reducing Cultural Polarization Using Aporetic ReasoningPI: Rob Robertson, California State University - FullertonCo-PI: Danieli Evans, Yale UniversityAbstract: For affect-laden or polarizing policy problems, policymakers and citizens may fail to converge on the best available empirical evidence, instead interpreting evidence and perceiving risks in accordance with their own worldviews. Judicial decisions are not immune to motivated reaction, as courts—particularly appellate courts—frequently must rule on issues that are both polarizing and rest on contested empirical foundations. Judges and other policymakers need evidence-based communication strategies that ameliorate motivated reaction. Our proposal tests the use of aporetic reasoning, a style of justification in which the decision-maker acknowledges the complexity and uncertainty of the question before them, affirming the strongest arguments or the most important values held by the losing side. We hypothesize that aporetic justifications will lower a dispute’s emotional stakes, making individuals less likely to feel that a decision they disagree with is an attack on their identity. We employ an experimental vignettes survey design to test the impact of aporia, using vignettes where judges rule on the constitutionality of state bans on concealed weapons or police use of deadly force. By doing so, we will test how aporetic reasoning impacts perceptions that a decision was accurate, fair and legitimate. Our work sits at the intersection of law, decision-making, psychology, and public opinion, testing a novel theory for reducing the negative impacts of motivated reasoning.STUDENT COMMITTEE ELECTION RESULTSThe Student Committee had many great candidates this year, and are pleased to announce the elected 2017-2018 student representatives:Chair - Amanda Reed | John Jay College of Criminal JusticeChair-Elect - Katherine Hazen | University of Nebraska - LincolnCommunications Officer - Victoria Pietruszka | Drexel UniversityCampus Representative Coordinator - Ryan Hunlock | Palo Alto UniversitySecretary - Keisha April | Drexel UniversityClinical Liaison - Amanda Rosinski | John Jay College of Criminal JusticeExperimental Liaison - Adele Quigley-McBride | Iowa State UniversityLaw Liaison - Emma Marshall  | University of Nebraska-LincolnPast-Chair - Emily Haney-Caron | Drexel UniversityOfficers will officially transition at the Division 41 Business Meeting during the APA Convention.

NEW PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVEEve Brank, Incoming  AP-LS PresidentLater this week, I will have the great honor of being the next AP-LS president. I’m humbled and grateful for the opportunity to serve AP-LS in this new role. As I described at our annual meeting in Seattle, I have an internal and external focus with my presidential initiative.  Internally, I want to focus on the way our organization works and ways to improve transitions between new committee chairs, committee members, and executive committee officers.  Externally, I want to focus on doing good and, at the very least, leave a positive impact in the cities in which we visit for our conferences.  Several of you volunteered to participate in one of these task forces. First, thank you for your willingness to contribute to AP-LS in this way. Second, if you volunteered, you should have received an email from me earlier this week. If you did volunteer and did not receive that email or you are still wanting to volunteer for one of these task forces, please email me by Aug 9 to be added to a group.  I look forward to working with each of to make AP-LS an even better organization than it already is.AP-LS @ APA  Division 41 in D.C.

Perhaps more importantly than the operations of Cook County Jail, Dr. Jones Tapia utilized the workings of her jail (both good and bad) as a method to make a call to action for improving services and outcomes at the correctional facilities in which we are involved every day.  Her specific recommendations:      Expansion of crisis intervention training for law enforcement officers. Provide law enforcement with the tools for effective de-escalation.    Development of partnerships between clinical providers and law enforcement.Collaborative partnerships both enhance law enforcement training and provide valuable service experience for clinicians.    Expansion of crisis services and drop off centers for police. The criminalization of mental illness will continue as long as dropping them off at jail remains easier and more efficient than available treatment centers (e.g., emergency departments).    Use of outpatient commitment. States with outpatient commitment laws can provide insight into effective practices to balance patient rights and reduction of offending behavior.    Dr. Jones Tapia’s work highlights a new era of correctional rehabilitation in which clinicians also provide operational oversight for jails and prisons. Her commentary offers opportunities for practitioners and researchers alike.  If you have a suggestion for correctional topics at future conferences, please send to the Corrections Committee Chair, Sarah Miller.    CALL FOR NOMINATIONS: TEACHING AWARD  The APF 2018 Charles L.

Two divisions lost a seat (Society for the Psychology of Women; Trauma Psychology) and two divisions gained a seat (Society of Counseling Psychology; Society for the Psychology of Religion and Spirituality). The percentage of votes AP-LS received slightly increased compared to last year, but AP-LS remains very low in the voting tallies. Make sure to vote each year to keep AP-LS' voice heard in APA! In 2020, the AP-LS Council representatives are Jason Cantone and Margaret Bull Kovera. \n\nThe bylaws amendment seeking to expand APA voting privileges for graduate students failed by a very narrow margin. Bylaws amendments must be approved by two-thirds (66.67%) of APA voting members, but only 65.98% voted to approve this amendment. The measure passed Council in August 2019 with 73% of Council Representatives voting yes. \n\n\n\n\n\nNEWSLETTER ARCHIVES\n\nArchives of the  newsletter are available at http://ap-ls.wildapricot.org/Newsletter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020 AP-LS CONFERENCE DETAILS\n\nThe 2020 AP-LS conference is quickly approaching.  The conference will be held in New Orleans, LA at the Sheraton Hotel, Canal Street, March 5 – March 7.  Continuing Education workshops will be held on Wednesday, March 4.\n\nHotel reservations and conference registration can be made at http://ap-ls.wildapricot.org.\n\nConference Early Bird registration ends January 31, 2020.\n\n\n\nAP-LS 2020 PRE-CONFERENCE WORKSHOP GRANTS\n\nThe AP-LS Continuing Education (CE) Committee is pleased to offer 10 grants to students and early career psychologists (defined as 7 years or less since last terminal degree was awarded) to attend pre-conference CE workshops on March 4, 2020.\n\nTo apply for one of these grants (which cover the workshop registration fee), please complete the application at https://forms.gle/Bk276VHScTUeapqf7 by Friday, January 10, 2020.  \n\nGrant recipients will be notified by January 24, 2020 (prior to the early registration rate deadline; Note: if you have already registered for a workshop, you can still apply and receive a refund for your registration fee). \n\nContact Beth Arredondo (bethcaillouet@gmail.com) with any questions.  \n\nWe look forward to receiving your applications!\n\n\n\nON THE JOB OR POSTDOC MARKET? AP-LS JOB POSTINGS\n\nCheck out AP-LS's Job Postings Page for up-to-date information on available psychology-law positions here.\n\nNote that new positions are available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLAW AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR UPDATES \n\nBradley D. McAuliff, JD, PhD (bradley.mcauliff@csun.edu)\n\nEditor-in-Chief\n\nI am excited to announce that Dr. Jennifer Cox has joined the Editorial Team of Law and Human Behavior. She and Dr. Dave DeMatteo will work with reviewers to make publication decisions for clinical submissions to the journal.\n\nDr. Cox received her doctorate in clinical psychology from Texas A&M University in 2014. She is currently an Associate Professor who specializes in clinical psychology-law at The University of Alabama. She has served on LHB Editorial Board since 2015 and currently serves on the editorial board of three journals and the AP-LS Committees for Research and Dissertation Awards. Her research interests include the impact of gender and race biases on legal decision making, forensic mental health assessment, psychopathy, and the interaction of psychology and public policy.\n\nDr. Cox replaces Dr. Amanda Zelechoski, who recently stepped down as Associate Editor to tend to family medical issues and to focus on several new projects. The journal not only benefitted from Dr. Zelechoski’s expertise as AE—she was also the driving force behind the journal’s new Reviewer Mentee Program. On behalf of Division 41, the LHB Editorial Team would like to thank Amanda for her service and we look forward to working with Dr. Cox in her new role as Associate Editor.\n\n\n\nRESEARCH BRIEFS\n\nTake a look at the latest research briefs for short summaries of the latest articles relevant to psychology-law. \n\nTo read the research briefs, please click here.AP-LS CONTACTS\n\nEmail addresses for all current EC members and Committee Chairs can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Editorial Board  Editor Marc Patry marc.patry@smu.ca Associate Editor Leah Georges  leahgeorges@creighton.edu Student Assistant Editor Sarah Shaw sarah.shaw@smu.ca Content Editors -  Research Briefs Charles Stone &  Rebecca  Weiss  chstone@jjay.cuny.edu rweiss@jjay.cuny.edu Content Editor - Legal Update Christopher King  kingch@mail.montclair.edu Content Editor - Expert Opinion  Melinda Wolbransky melinda.wolbransky@gmail.com Content Editor - Teaching in Psych & Law Christina Riggs Romaine riggsromaine_christina@wheatoncollege.edu Content Editor - Advances in Psych &  Law Alice Thornewill & Shelby Arnold alice.thornewill@gmail.com shelby.a.arnold@gmail.com Content Editor - Career CornerVictoria Pietruszka aplsstudents@gmail.comMembership Services        AP-LS seeks to advance the science of psychology - law and the translation of psychology-law knowledge into practice and policy.  Our mission is to enhance well-being, justice, and human rights through science and practice of psychology in legal contexts. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Copyright © American Psychology-Law Society                        Division 41 of the American Psychological Association All rights reserved.                   PO Box 805, Harrisburg, NC 28075Unsubscribe from E-NewsUnsubscribe from all APLS e-mails\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n    © 2022 American Psychology-Law Society  made with  and Quarto"

The AP-LS Executive Committee voted unanimously to approve the revisions and submit them to the AP-LS membership for ratification.  Per the existing By-Laws language in Article VI, Section 1: “Ratification of the proposed amendment requires a two-thirds majority of those of the membership voting, or by a two-thirds vote of those members attending any annual meeting.” The AP-LS Executive Committee is therefore asking AP-LS members to ratify the By-Laws revisions.  Please review this document in advance of the voting to review a summary of the key changes as well the line-by-line specific proposed changes.  The voting link will be mailed to all members eligible to vote soon.

AP-LS 2018 CONFERENCE: THE PEABODY MEMPHIS  The 2018 conference will be held March 8-10 at the beautiful and historic Peabody Hotel in Memphis, TN, with optional pre-conference workshops on March 7.    The \"Peabody Ducks\" have made the hotel world-famous.  These ducks live on the swanky hotel rooftop and make daily treks to the fountain in the lobby, a tradition dating back to at least the 1930s (if not way back to to hotel's opening in 1869).      2017 APA CONVENTION  Division 41 in D.C.

Media Portrayals of Social Science in the Law    In the Legal Update section of the latest AP-LS PDF Newsletter, Trisha E. Volpe of Barnes & Thornburg, LLP and ThemeVision LLC wrote about how this new show has sparked some debate in the trial consulting and social science communities.    The controversy is about how the media depicts psychologists and other social scientists in the legal system and how these depictions affect public perceptions of the profession.    Read the interesting article on pages 3-4 of the PDF Newsletter for more.  Thanks to Associate Editor Dennis P.

APA COMMITTEE ON LEGAL ISSUES (COLI) SEEKS NEW MEMBERSThe APA Committee on Legal Issues (COLI) is one of the most pertinent ways for AP-LS members to become better involved in APA governance and leadership activities. COLI makes recommendations, prepares and issues reports, and educates APA and psychologists about psycho-legal issues and to promote the field of psychology as it interfaces with the law. COLI does not serve as legal counsel to or form an attorney-client relationship with the APA or the Board of Directors. Instead, COLI has a primary responsibility for serving as a “think tank” for the Board of Directors on psycho-legal issues. Nominations are sought for one JD/PhD position and two PhD or PsyD positions. The term of service for all positions is Jan. 1, 2020-Dec. 31, 2022. COLI members must also be APA members. Applications should include (1) a brief statement of no more than 300 words detailing qualifications, and (2) a current curriculum vitae. Nominees' materials will be reviewed by COLI and COLI will send their recommendations to the Board of Directors for review. Applications are due September 27 to COLInominations@apa/org. For more information, please go to: https://www.apa.org/about/offices/ogc/legal-committee-nominations.AP-LS 2020 CONFERENCEThe conference submission site for the AP-LS 2020 conference will be open on September 1, 2019, with submissions due by 11:59 PST on October 4, 2019.

The External-Focused Presidential Task Force has developed a few options for the upcoming conference in Memphis and they would like to hear whether you are interested in being involved in this outreach. We have brainstormed a few ideas including doing presentations or trainings with local attorneys, correctional facility employees, social workers, and students in high schools, community colleges, or universities.For those of you who have or who will submit a proposal for the AP-LS conference, the submission portal provides an opportunity to express interest in participating in this externally focused initiative. If you are not planning on submitting a proposal for AP-LS and you would still like to know more about this initiative, then please follow this link http://goo.gl/o8fZBc where you can indicate your interest. Please do so by October 6th. More details will be provided soon!AP-LS STUDENT COMMITTEE: CAREER CORNERThe Career Corner is intended to highlight the individuals who work at the intersection of law and psychology, where they come from, how they got there and how their experiences influence their research, teaching, and/or practice. This edition of Career Corner profiles Eve M. Brank, J.D., Ph.D, the 2017-2018 President of the APA Division 41 American Psychology-Law Society. Click here to view this edition of Career Corner.COLLABORATIVE APA SYMPOSIUMThe Human Animal Interactions (HAI) section of Division 17 (Counseling Psychology) is working with Divisions 20 and 54 on creating a collaborative symposium on the topic of emotional support dogs and service dogs. As there are many legal issues associated with this, Division 41 would be a natural collaborator in this effort.

We are currently seeking volunteers to help cover the desk. Volunteers will be asked to select at least one hour that works best for them. To be a volunteer consultant, one does not have to be a statistician, only proficient in the computation and/or interpretation of statistics.  For this reason, it will be made clear to consultation table users that the expectation for service should not be comparable to the expectations placed on a paid statistical consultant.  Last, you do not need to be an early career psychologist to volunteer.  If you are interested in volunteering, please email James Andretta at jamesrandretta@gmail.com, and provide him with your full name, your institution, 3 to 4 areas of statistical competence/expertise, and the statistical software package(s) that you are most familiar with using.After the release of the AP-LS 2018 conference schedule, James will provide all volunteers with access to an e-calendar to sign up for a specific day and time to help cover the desk for one hour.

Following August’s focus on adult treatment practices and whether such treatments actually “work,” Amanda M. Fanniff, Ph.D., Associate Professor at Palo Alto University, focuses on adolescents who have committed sexual offenses. As with part one of the series, we start by asking the question, “How do we measure treatment in this area?”To read this column, please click here.LEGAL UPDATE: ASSESSING THREATS OF SELF-DIRECTED VIOLENCE AND DUTIES OF CARE WITHIN HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS: NGUYEN V. MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (2018)Whereas threat assessment professionals in the United States and Canada may well be aware of case law, other legal standards, and their professional responsibilities regarding assessing and managing risk of violence toward others, fewer may be as familiar with sources of authority regarding self-directed violence threat assessment. It may be reassuring to know that our professional responsibilities related to assessing and managing other- and self-directed violence are somewhat analogous, and the courts have historically, as well as more recently, underscored this view.To read more about this, please click here.CAREER CORNERThe Career Corner is intended to highlight the individuals who work at the intersection of law and psychology, where they come from, how they got there and how their experiences influence their research, teaching, and/or practice.

PRESIDENTIAL COLUMNJennifer GroscupIt was an honor to be elected President of AP-LS, and I am very much looking forward to working with all of you in the upcoming year on our organization. The first thing I want to do is tell you about my Presidential initiative: Embracing Leadership: Developing Skills for Your Career Evolution. This is a leadership training program for our members that will provide participants with the skills and the opportunities to become leaders within our Division and beyond. Based on surveys of our membership and on the surveys done on specific subgroups within our membership (ECPs, Student Section, etc.), there appears to be a high level of interest in leadership development. Many members have expressed the desire to be involved in leadership, but they feel it is difficult to “break into” leadership in the Division. This perception is one of many barriers to leadership for our members, and this feeling is not limited to leadership within the Division.To read the rest of this column, please click here. DIVISION 41 CALL FOR REVIEWERS: APA 128th 2020 ANNUAL CONVENTIONWe are looking for reviewers to review submitted programming proposals for the 128th Annual Convention of the American Psychological Association to be held Aug 6 – 9, 2020 in Washington, DC.Proposals will be in the following formats: symposia, skill-building sessions, discussions, data blitzes, and posters.Student reviewers are welcome!For more information, please click here.The deadline to sign up to be a reviewer is December 2, 2019.CALL FOR APPLICATIONS: EMBRACING LEADERSHIP: DEVELOPING SKILLS FOR YOUR CAREER EVOLUTIONThe American Psychology-Law Society is starting a leadership development program, and we encourage any and all members to apply for this exciting opportunity!Embracing Leadership is designed to provide our members with practical training in leadership and with leadership opportunities within AP-LS.

COLI makes recommendations, prepares and issues reports, and educates APA and psychologists about psycho-legal issues and to promote the field of psychology as it interfaces with the law. COLI does not serve as legal counsel to or form an attorney-client relationship with the APA or the Board of Directors. Instead, COLI has a primary responsibility for serving as a “think tank” for the Board of Directors on psycho-legal issues. Nominations are sought for one JD/PhD position and two PhD or PsyD positions.

APA UPDATE: STUDENT/ECP GRANTS AND CALL FOR COMMENTS(1) The American Psychological Foundation and APA announced $1,000 grants to seed innovation through supporting teaching, education, and intervention projects and programs using psychology to solve social problems such as: how to apply psychology to at-risk, vulnerable populations (e.g., serious mental illness, returning military, those who are incarcerated or economically disadvantaged), preventing violence, understanding the connection between behavior and health (e.g. wellness, diabetes, obesity), and understanding and eliminating stigma and prejudice (e.g. race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability and socioeconomic status). Applicants must be graduate students or early career researchers (within 10 years of Ph.D.) More information can be obtained at https://www.apa.org/apf/funding/weiss.  Applications are due September 15, 2019. (2) APA seeks member and public comments on the proposed Guidelines for Psychological Practice with Military Service Members, Veterans, and their Families (SMVF). The purpose of these guidelines is to “provide recommendations for psychologists who provide services to SMVF outside of Veterans Health Administration or U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) facilities.” In addition, these guidelines aim to “highlight the main issues that are unique to this particular population that would not necessarily also be of consideration in the civilian population. The successful application of these guidelines involves use of clinical judgment, recognition of one’s own scope of practice, and an understanding of the extent to which military status is part of an individual’s identity or relevant to the individual’s need for psychological care.” Comments can be provided by June 7, 2019 at http://apps.apa.org/commentcentral2/default.aspx?site=40.  For questions related to these updates, please contact your APA Council of Representatives delegates Tom Grisso or Jason Cantone (jasoncantone@gmail.com).

CALL FOR E-NEWS EDITOR  AP-LS has had a quarterly PDF newsletter for many years. However, as part of the organization's plan to become more nimble and modern, we are phasing out the old quarterly PDF newsletter and replacing it with these monthly e-news mailings.  We will continue to have the same kinds of content as the PDF newsletter, but will now deliver the content across 12 months rather than just 4 times per year.    The time has come for a new editor to be appointed to the post.  Matthew Huss's term as the PDF newsletter editor is coming to a close, and AP-LS would like to appoint the new editor to take over the e-news and help transition us from the PDF format into this newer e-news format.Are you interested in serving in this new e-news editor role?  If so, please send an email with your statement of interest and your CV to Jennifer Woolard.  AP-LS COMMITTEE SERVICE OPPORTUNITIESA Note for Committee Chairs and Interested MembersWe launched a google form about two months ago to have people indicate their interest in serving on various AP-LS committees, and the form was announced at the conference too. We have hundreds of people interested in serving on committees, which is great news!  The committee chairs will begin going through the data soon and contacting people who indicated interest in their committees.We are asking all committee chairs and all interested people serving in committees to use this form for the new member application process for the sake of consistency, transparency, and fairness.Full committee terms of reference (descriptions of committees) are here. Committee chairs will use the responses to the form to then contact interested applicants directly with a request for more information. Service terms are normally three years, with initial appointments in August.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW: ADVANCES IN PSYCHOLOGY AND LAW      Part of AP-LS President David DeMatteo's presidential initiative is to send out quarterly updates regarding new cases, laws, etc. that are of interest to the psychology-law community. These updates will be published in the e-news, and the first installment is ready this month.      Jan - Mar 2017 Update    This is the first installment of a quarterly review and summary of the valuable advancements in the psychological and legal fields. Our goal is to present this information in a comprehensive, but an easily digestible format. Each update will include summaries of relevant and current research findings and legal developments with links to further information.  Sometimes staying on top of all the news, research and legal updates relevant to the field can be a daunting task. Our hope with this quarterly update is to save you some time and keep you informed!     In the Courtroom  Jury Decision-MakingWorried about evidence suggesting race bias in juries? On March 6, 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that courts must make an exception to the rule that jury deliberations remain secret if they are impacted by racial or ethnic bias. See Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado. For those who do conduct jury simulation research, this new study may help alleviate concerns about using undergraduate student samples to represent mock juries.Using Race as a Risk Factor: Racial Bias in the CourtroomThe Supreme Court recently held that a Texas death row inmate’s sentencing was unfairly biased by blatantly racist expert testimony. In short, his own attorney’s expert testified that the defendant is more likely to commit violent acts because he is black. See Buck v. Davis.Juvenile Sentencing: What Does Society Think?As a reminder, SCOTUS recently held that mandatory life in prison without parole (LWOP)  for juvenile offenders is unconstitutional (because it violates the 8th Amendment prohibition of “cruel and unusual punishment”).  But what about non-mandatory LWOP sentencing? A recent study examined the public’s sentiment regarding juvenile LWOP and, among other findings, found that only 31% of participants agree with juvenile LWOP as a general policy.Intellectual Disability and the Death PenaltyOn March 28, 2017 the Supreme Court continued its trend toward limiting capital punishment for those with intellectual disability (continued in next column).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW (CONTINUED)(Continued from previous column). The Court rejected Texas’s standards for deciding whether an individual’s intellectual disability would preclude him from receiving the death penalty. In writing for the majority, Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg reasoned that Texas’s approach was not consistent with current medical standards, placed too much weight on I.Q. scores, and considered factors rooted in stereotypes.  See Moore v. Texas. In the Community     Improving the Process for Prisoner ReentryReentry programming for previously incarcerated offenders seems like a great idea, but where is the research supporting it? Recent research has shown that individuals feel they may not be receiving the services they need. So what’s the answer? Better integrate offender-perceived needs with needs highlighted in actuarial assessments.This bill filed in Kentucky, if passed, may be a good model for improving success in reentry. The bill aims to provide workforce training during incarceration, ease restrictions that prevent released offenders from getting jobs, and provide a reentry drug supervision pilot program.Improving Citizen-Law Enforcement Relations: Police AccountabilityThis global multi-site randomized clinical trial examined the use of body-worn cameras on police and whether it reduced citizen’s complaints. Studies like this are increasingly more important as tensions have increased among officers and the populations they serve.Mental Health Care & the Trump AdministrationAs many are aware, the Trump administration has begun to withdraw federal protections for transgender individuals. This will likely have a large impact on the transgender community, and an even larger impact for incarcerated transgender individuals. As institutional barriers are resurrected, it might be helpful for practicing clinicians to review these guidelines when working with transgender clients. As the status of the Affordable Care Act remains in question, see this article for the perspective of some concerned psychologists.  Final ThoughtsAnd Lastly, on a positive note…For information on a promising program, check out NPR’s inspiring Hidden Brain podcast on a CBT program in Chicago designed to reduce violence and increase high school graduate rates among teenage boys.Until June!If you have questions, or see or read something you would like to see included in future updates, please contact us!

Although there was a decline in the number of votes cast by APA members for Division 41 in the 2024 apportionment process, we did maintain our two Council of Representative seats. To maintain these two Division 41 seats on Council, it will be important for those APLS members who are also APA members to cast more of their votes for Division 41 in the next apportionment vote.\n \nOutcome of Voting on Amendments to APA Bylaws\nAll three of the most recently proposed amendments to the APA bylaws were approved by the membership (proportion of voting members approving in parentheses below).\n \n\nAmendment #1 – Update Mission of Membership Board to be in Alignment with Current Practices  (84.05%)\nAmendment #2 – Association Members Gain Voting Privileges After One Year Instead of Five Years (73.33%)\nAmendment #3 – Add a Graduate Student member on the Board for the Advancement of Psychology in the Public Interest, Board of Convention Affairs, Board of Educational Affairs, Board of Professional Affairs, Board of Scientific Affairs, Membership Board and Policy and Planning Board (82.28%)\n\n \nLeadership Opportunities & Fellowships\nAPA seeks nominations (including self-nominations) for its many boards and committees. We strongly encourage you to review the openings and nomination instructions. This is a great way to gain leadership experience and to get the voice of AP-LS heard within APA governance. You need to be an APA member to serve on an APA board or committee. Nominations are due January 31. Election slates are then developed and the APA Board of Directors approves the slates by mid-April. APA Council members then vote in Fall 2023. Additional questions can be directed to the APA Election Office at elections@apa.org. \n \nAPA also seeks nominees for the APA Congressional Fellowship program and APA Executive Branch Science Fellowship. Applications are due January 30. \n \nStandards of Accreditation for Master's Degree Programs\nAPA seeks public comments on Implementing Regulations related to the Standards of Accreditation for Health Service Psychology, Master’s Degree Programs, which outline education and training requirements for the accreditation of health service psychology programs at the master’s level. Information about the proposed standards and public comment is available on their website. Comments are due by February 2, 2023. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAP-LS 2023 Submission Decisions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecisions regarding AP-LS 2023 conference submissions have been published.

Practitioners are in a unique position to offer education, assessment, intervention and advocacy on issues of REC disparities, racism, and discrimination in the field of psychology and the law. However, a limited body of research, lack of practice guidelines on REC integration in forensic practice, and low representation of Black, Indigenous, People Of Color (BIPOC) professionals, limit such efforts. Mentorship of emerging practitioners in psychology and the law on such issues can bridge the gap of knowledge, application, and BIPOC representation in the field.  \n \nThe AP-LS Practice Committee wants to recognize the substantive contributions of practitioner mentors who educate and support emerging clinicians in psychology and the law with a lens toward the elimination of REC disparities and social justice. For these purposes, we use Goldstein’s (2007) definition of the practice of psychology and the law: “The application of psychological research, theory, practice, and traditional and specialized methodology (e.g.  interviewing, psychological testing, forensic assessment, and forensically relevant instruments) to provide information relevant to a legal question.”  \n \nThe award for Outstanding Practitioner Mentoring to Eliminate Racial, Ethnic and Cultural (REC) Disparities in the Field of Psychology and the Law, will be conferred on a yearly basis. The Recipient will receive a $500.00 cash award, a plaque to be presented at the annual AP-LS conference and will be featured in an AP-LS newsletter article, written by the practice committee, highlighting the recipient’s achievements and recommendations to other practitioners. Highlighting the recipient's mentorship practices and experiences can serve as a model for other professionals in the field of psychology and the law.  \n\nNomination packages are due January 15, 2023 and should be emailed to the chair of the award subcommittee, Dr. Lara Guzmán-Hosta at lguzman.hosta@gmail.com.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBRIDGE Committee Award Programs\nCall for Applications 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AP-LS Broadening Representation Inclusion, Diversity, and Global Equity or BRIDGE Committee is seeking applicants for two award programs. As part of the BRIDGE Committee initiative to increase diversity within AP-LS, and the profession as a whole, these award programs support research for undergraduate and graduate students. Please take a few minutes to review the program descriptions below and consider if you or any students you know might be eligible, and encourage them to apply. Also, please feel free to forward this information to any colleagues who might be interested in these award programs. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15, 2022 through January 15, 2023. Recipients will be announced in February 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit Award Applications \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess Path to Psychology and Law Experience Program\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Access Path to Psychology and Law Experience (AP) Program is to increase diversity within psychology and law by increasing the pipeline of competitive graduate school applicants from groups that currently are underrepresented in the field, including racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and disabled students. AP is designed to encourage faculty members to recruit students from underrepresented groups into their research labs. It provides financial support for the students to obtain meaningful research experience and attend the AP-LS conference as well as other opportunities for mentoring and development. It is the intention of the BRIDGE Committee that many of the students in the AP program will apply for graduate training related to psychology and law and ultimately become professionals in the field. The AP program primarily targets undergraduate students, but students from terminal master’s degree programs will also be considered. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15, 2022 through January 15, 2023. Recipients will be announced in February 2023.\n\nFor more information about the AP Program, please contact the program Chair, Dr. Jason Lawrence at jason.lawrence@dmh.mo.gov.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit Award Applications \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAP-LS Diversity in Psychology and Law Research Awards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Diversity in Psychology and Law Research Awards is to promote diversity within the American Psychology-Law Society by supporting student research on psycholegal issues related to diversity as well as research by students from underrepresented groups. Projects are eligible for consideration for this award if (1) they investigate topics related to psychology, law, diversity, and/or multiculturalism (e.g., research pertaining to psycholegal issues on race, gender, culture, sexual orientation, etc.) or (2) if the principal investigator is a member of an underrepresented group, including racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and students with disabilities. Consistent with the mission of the BRIDGE Committee, these awards are intended to facilitate the research of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in AP-LS, as well as research about issues of potential interest and importance to such groups. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15, 2022 through January 15, 2023. Recipients will be announced in February 2023.\n\nFor more information about the Diversity Program, please contact the program Chair, Dr. Evelyn Maeder at evelyn.maeder@carlton.ca.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit Award Applications \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversity Travel Awards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of an initiative to increase diversity within AP-LS, the Minority Affairs Committee will provide travel awards to students from underrepresented groups (i.e., racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and students with disabilities) who are presenting research at the American Psychology-Law Society Conference. Seven competitive travel awards in the amount of $500 will be given. Award submissions will be accepted starting September 15, 2022 through January 15, 2023.

It is important that you promptly respond to this email to help keep AP-LS's voice heard within APA.Your vote will determine how many voting members AP-LS gets on APA's governing body, the Council of Representatives. Right now, AP-LS has two representatives. Depending on the number of votes that AP-LS gets during this ballot process, AP-LS could gain or lose a representative. Each APA member is given 10 votes. Please give all 10 of your votes to Division 41/AP-LS. This ballot also includes a proposed change to the APA bylaws to allow some graduate student members the right to vote in some APA elections, as further explained on the ballot. In August, the APA Council of Representatives (including the two AP-LS representatives) voted in favor (73.4%) of the item, and the APA Board of Directors recommended approval. If you have any questions, please contact Jason Cantone, at jasoncantone@gmail.com. If you are an APA member and did not receive the ballot email, please contact Garnett Coad, at gcoad@apa.org. UNDERSTANDING THE NEEDS OF AP-LS EARLY CAREER PROFESSIONALSIn late 2018, 119 AP-LS early career professionals (ECPs) completed a detailed survey regarding their graduate training, professional development, current career path, and recommendations for how AP-LS can meet the needs of ECPs. This survey provided a wealth of information. Some findings include: -  Diversity. Respondents overwhelmingly self-identified as White (81%) and female (83%) and noted a need for more diversity awareness and recruitment, as well as a desire for more training in socio-cultural issues in law and psychology, and harassment and discrimination claims. - Debt. Respondents’ average student debt load at the time of graduation was a little over $100,000, with about $89,000 attributable solely to graduate training. Respondents who received a PsyD reported the highest debt load. - Meeting ECP Needs.  Only 5% of respondents said that AP-LS addressed their needs extremely well, with the most saying moderately well. Respondents recommended that AP-LS provide further opportunities regarding peer networking, professional networking, and how to establish collaborations outside of academia. - Policy and Applied Areas. Respondents reported satisfaction with many aspects of their graduate training, but many expressed disappointment with a lack of guidance on going into the non-academic job market, and a need for more training in policy areas and better experiential learning opportunities. This was especially likely for social science respondents. The full report is available here. Questions can be directed to Jason Cantone, at jasoncantone@gmail.com. ON THE JOB OR POSTDOC MARKET? AP-LS JOB POSTINGSCheck out AP-LS's Job Postings Page for up-to-date information on available psychology-law positions here.Note that new positions are available.NEWSLETTER ARCHIVESArchives of the  newsletter are available at http://ap-ls.wildapricot.org/Newsletter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 2019 SALEEM SHAH AWARD: CALL FOR NOMINATIONSThe Saleem Shah Award is an annual award co-sponsored by the American Academy of Forensic Psychology (AAFP) and the American Psychology-Law Society (AP-LS), recognizing early career excellence and contributions to the field of psychology and law.  The focus of a nominee's contributions may be in any area of forensic psychology practice, research, or public policy.

LAW AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR UPDATEBradley D. McAuliff, JD, PhD (bradley.mcauliff@csun.edu)California State University, NorthridgeThe Editorial Team recently received two important journal updates that we would like to share with Division 41.This summer, Clarivate Analytics’ Social Science Citation Index released LHB’s impact factor for 2018. Measuring the average number of times articles from the journal published in 2016 and 2017 were cited in 2018, the impact factor decreased slightly from 2.867 in 2017 to 2.780 in 2018. The journal’s 5-year impact factor, measuring the average number of times articles from the journal published between 2013 and 2017 were cited in 2018, rose from to 3.245 to 3.372.LHB’s ranking in the law category was 11 out of 148 and the journal was outranked by only one other psychology title, European Journal of Psychology Applied to Legal Context, which is an open access journal. In the social psychology category, LHB ranked 15 out of 63.APA Journals also released its annual publishing report for LHB. The rate of submissions to the journal in 2018 increased 3% compared to 2017 and the rate is about 12% higher so far this year. The rejection rate decreased slightly from 85% last year to 81% in 2018. Editorial lag, or time between submission and first decision, also decreased from 6 weeks in 2017 to 4 weeks last year. Production lag, or time between acceptance and publication in an issue, was about 6 weeks for articles posted online and less than 3 months for articles included in issues.The impact of LHB--combined with the steady submission rate, a short editorial and publication lag, and a rejection rate that hovers around 80%--suggests the journal remains very healthy. That said, we continue to need your best work! This is especially the case for clinical submissions, which are underrepresented and constitute roughly 20% of all submissions to the journal. Please consider submitting now and do not hesitate to contact me, or any of the Associate Editors (David DeMatteo, Amanda Zelechoski, Jennifer Hunt, Lora Levett, and Kyle Scherr) if you have any questions or we can help in any way.CALL FOR SYLLABIThe TTC Committee is continuing its efforts to collect syllabi for courses in Psychology and Law or closely related topics. There are already a number of syllabi that have been collected over the years on the AP-LS website. However, we would like to routinely post new syllabi. We would appreciate your assistance in providing us with a copy of your syllabi.If you have not already provided one, please do so in the following way: Send a copy of your syllabi to Jonathan Golding (golding@uky.edu). Soft copies may be submitted as e-mail attachments (Word Perfect, Word, or ASCII files are preferred).AP-LS BOOK AWARD COMMITTEE INVITES NOMINATIONSThe AP-LS Book Award Committee is inviting nominations to recognize outstanding scholarship in psychology and law edited books published in 2017 and 2018.

It seeks to highlight the unique contributions each group can make to the field of law-psychology. Each article will be co-authored by a student, a psychologist, and a legal professional in order to explore relevant issues from each perspective. In this first article, Jennifer Kamorowski, J.D., Heather Ellis Cucolo, J.D., & Allison D.

February 14-17, 2019. APLS/Division 41 is represented by Jason Cantone and Tom Grisso. At the meeting, Jason Cantone was re-appointed to the Council Diversity Working Group, and elected Member-at-Large for the Public Interest Caucus. Among items on the agenda, Council approved the:· Resolution on Campus Sexual Assault,· Clinical Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Depression Across Three Age Cohorts,· Resolution on Physical Discipline of Children by Parents, after some concerns were expressed about whether the resolution’s claim that science supports that spanking leads to negative outcomes has actually been shown, and concern that the resolution would result in disparities for certain racial, ethnic or cultural communities more likely to use spanking,· 2019 Children and Adolescent Mental and Behavioral Health Resolution (rescinding the now out-of-date 2004 resolution on the same topic),· Revised Model Education and Training Program in Psychopharmacology for Prescriptive Authority,· Creation of a new APA journal, Technology, Mind, and Behavior, and· Proposed change to rules on how Divisions can issue public statements on matters consistent with APA policy, and the information required in APA elections.Last year, Council passed a “transparency” rule to provide for representatives’ individual votes to be made available on the APA website, if 2/3 of Council voted to do so at the beginning of each meeting. Although both APLS representatives voted in support, only 58% of Council supported the motion and it did not pass. Following passionate discussion on the Council members’ LISTSERV, there was an information session regarding the ethical, moral, and legal issues surrounding APA accrediting graduate psychology programs at schools that discriminate against minority (generally, on the basis of sexual orientation) populations. A New Business Item on this issue was proposed for discussion at future meetings.Council also heard from task forces on (1) the new APA strategic plan, which seeks to create a more unifying framework within APA to more readily advocate for psychology, and (2) master’s program accreditation, which will next work on articulating competencies and accreditation standards for masters-level health services professionals, which will still need to be developed and approved.For more on these issues, please contact APLS Council Rep Jason Cantone at jasoncantone@gmail.com. AP-LS CONTACTSEmail addresses for all current EC members and Committee Chairs can be found here.

The HIG research program commissions basic and applied scientific studies and field validation/effectiveness studies to examine current and new approaches to interrogation to develop and refine an effective, non-coercive, science-based model of interrogation, interviewing, and debriefing that is both legally and ethically sound. We fund/commission these basic and applied research projects through a mechanism called the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). We are currently soliciting new white papers for potential contract funding with a deadline of March 29, 2019.For more information, please click here and select “Amendment 1” for the current call for papers.

AP-LS VOICES HEARD IN APACongratulations to Dr. Erika Fountain on her selection as a member of the new APA Advisory Group for Applied Psychology. The advisory group, which will be led by APA's Office of Applied Psychology, will have two main charges: 1) to make recommendations about how applied psychology can be better represented in APA; and 2) serve as a source of input and feedback regarding applied psychology issues and priorities. We are excited to see AP-LS part of this important advisory group.Jason Cantone was selected for the new APA Work Group on Accommodating Young Families. The work group is tasked with examining how APA could better support young families attending governance meetings and the annual convention (e.g., child care grants, on-site child care, nursing resources, family-friendly resources). During the first meeting, AP-LS was commended for its child care grants to assist families attending the annual AP-LS conference. If you're interested in serving on an APA group, APA is currently looking for new members for its Continuing Education Committee (applications due August 12), Committee on Early Career Psychologists (due August 28), Committee on Disability Issues in Psychology (due August 30), and APA Fellows Committee (due September 10). Contact APA Council Representative Jason Cantone (jasoncantone@gmail.com) for application materials. AP-LS CONTACTSEmail addresses for all current EC members and Committee Chairs can be found here.NEWSLETTER ARCHIVESArchives of the  newsletter are available at http://ap-ls.wildapricot.org/Newsletter.

APLS was represented by Jason Cantone and Joel Lieberman. At this meeting, Council voted to move forward on accrediting master's level psychology programs and approved guidelines on core learning goals for master's degree graduates in psychology.This occurred after about 70 years of discussion on the topic of master's programs. APA also shared that, for the first time, there were more internship positions available than applicants. For the 432 unmatched students in the 2018 APPIC Phase I match, 457 APA/CPA-accredited internships were still open.Council also voted to approve a major organizational structure change, with APA changing from a 501(c)(3) to a joint 501(c)(6) organization. Why does this matter? The changed tax status allows for more advocacy and fewer lobbying restrictions. APA promised that increased lobbying will be on behalf of science as much as for practitioner issues. All APA members will become members of this new joint organization when they renew next year. APA promised that dues will not go up for at least three years, but there is concern they will go up after that, because APAPO (APA's current 501(c)(6) to focus on practice issues) will no longer receive its own, separate dues. Final plans will be discussed at APA in August. In addition, APA is currently hiring a Chief Ethics Officer and will begin the process of hiring a Chief Diversity Officer later this year.If you have any questions about these decisions or would like to know more about the other decisions at Council, including the passage of new clinical practice guidelines regarding obesity, please contact Jason Cantone (jasoncantone@gmail.com). COMMONLY REPORTED STATISTICS & CONCEPTS QUICK REFERENCE SHEETMorgan, Slobogin, & Andretta (2018) reviewed 93 articles published in 2017 in Psychology, Public Policy, and Law or Law and Human Behavior in order to determine the most commonly reported statistical coefficients and concepts.

EXPERT OPINION: HOT TUBBING AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO ADVERSARIAL EXPERT TESTIMONYInitially developed in Australian courts, concurrent expert testimony, or “hot tubbing,” is a practice in which two experts sit together in a witness box and provide concurrent testimony.

A hearty thank you to Lindsey Wylie and Nick Druhn, our conference co-chairs for their tireless work on the conference program and so much more.  The plenary sessions were thought-provoking and encouraged me to approach issues differently than I had before.  The new data blitz sessions were a welcome opportunity to get to hear research from a variety of different areas that I likely would not have seen without the data blitz format. Thank you also to Kathy Gaskey, our administrative assistant, for her work with the conference and our organization all year. At the conference, we did several calls for committee volunteers and we have already had a great response. More than 150 people have volunteered to be considered for a committee position.  If you did not have a chance to submit your interest in joining a committee, please do so here https://goo.gl/forms/iQF3X5NtDnofxcUx2 by April 15th. With so many volunteers, it is a fairly lengthy process to get all our committee positions set by mid-summer in time for the annual process of rotating on new members at the APA meeting in August. I ask for your patience as we work through the process, but also feel free to reach out to me at ebrank2@unl.edu if you have any questions. VOLUNTEER FOR AP-LS COMMITTEESAP-LS is looking to recruit volunteers!

Her dissertation, entitled “Are children really the poorer eyewitnesses: An analysis of counterintuitive developmental trends in eyewitness memory,” comprised a series of studies investigating the malleability of developmental trends in eyewitness memory and testing methods to improve witness recall. The reviewers were extremely impressed with the dissertation work. “The author strings together, elegantly, a series of multi-study manuscripts to review developmental trends in eyewitness memory.The author puts the work together thoughtfully and meaningfully. The work throughout is of high quality with rigorous methodology.” The originality of the research also came through: “From the formatting and organizational structure, to the examination of adolescents, there is a sense of novelty throughout.The author is pushing the field forward to investigate an old problem in a new vein.” In addition, the reviewers noted the substantial contribution of the research to both researcher and practitioner communities.  Dr. Brackmann completed her dissertation under the supervision of Dr. Merckelbach at Maastricht University and Dr. Granhag at the University of Gothenburg.Dr. Melissa Colloff is the 2nd place dissertation award winner. Her dissertation, entitled “Eyewitness  identification performanceon lineups for distinctive suspects,” investigated how the three lineup techniques for distinctive suspects influence eyewitness identification performance. She found that all three methods enable witnesses to confidently make accurate decisions, regardless of age. The research addresses an important and under-researched area through a progression of five studies. The reviewers noted that the research provides “a compelling case in favor of police employing any one of the three examined methods to maintain lineup fairness in cases involving a suspect with a distinct facial feature—an important applied contribution.” Dr. Colloff completed her dissertation under the supervision of Dr. Wade at Warwick University. Dr. Lauren Kois is the 3rd place dissertation award winner. Her dissertation, entitled “Criminal responsibility: A meta-analysis and study space,” systematically assessed predictors of criminal responsibility outcomes and identified significant study-level characteristics. Hers is the first meta-analysis in the area. The reviewers noted the dissertation was exceptionally strong in terms of presentation; the literature review was clear, the description of the meta-analysis process was meticulous, the findings were clear, and the discussion was thorough. They also noted the “strong contribution to identifying necessary lines of future research.” Dr. Kois completed her dissertation under the supervision of Dr. Chauhan at John Jay College, City University of New York.ON THE JOB OR POSTDOC MARKET? AP-LS JOB POSTINGSCheck out AP-LS's Job Postings Page for up-to-date information on available psychology-law positions here.Note that new positions are available.

Though applying psychological research to the legal system goes back as far as 1885, it was officially recognized by the American Psychological Association in 2001 and has since experienced rapid growth.  As the field of forensic psychology continues to advance, it is imperative training and educational curricula adequately prepares future practitioners and researchers alike.To read this column, please click here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 LEGAL UPDATE: CONTINUING EDUCATION TO BETTER ENHANCE THE ATTORNEY/CLINICIAN RELATIONSHIPContent Contributors: Michael L. Perlin, Esq. & Heather Ellis CucoloThe two of us have taught together, written together, consulted and presented together for years. Mostly, we have done this with lawyers, law students, psychologists and psychology students. For 14 years, one of us (MLP) ran an online mental disability law program at New York Law School (NYLS), and for the last five, HEC has run it. Through this program, we have offered courses at NYLS and at other law schools and graduate schools (including a school of professional psychology) throughout the US and in multiple foreign nations. We also, for eight years, ran a masters’ program in mental disability law studies, and psychologists regularly made up a majority of students in that program. And we created a joint program with John Jay so that students could receive a J.D. from NYLS and an M.A. in forensic psychology from Jay.To read this column, please click here.

Though we have successfully developed such treatments for many forensic populations, there remains a lack of clearly identified and supported evidenced-based practices for individuals who have committed sexual offenses. In this three-part series, Amanda M. Fanniff, Ph.D., Associate Professor at Palo Alto University, will review current practices and examine whether such treatments actually “work.” This month’s column, Does Treatment for Adults who have Committed Sexual Offenses Work? A Simple Question with a Complicated Answer, focuses on adults who have committed sexual offenses and the next two will look at adolescents who have committed sexual offenses as well as minor attracted persons who want to remain offense-free. We start by asking the question, “How do we measure treatment in this area?”. To read this column, please click here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          AP-LS BOOK AWARD COMMITTEE INVITES NOMINATIONSThe AP-LS Book Award Committee invites nominations to recognize outstanding scholarship in psychology and law edited books published in 2017 and 2018.

    "text": "Overview\nThis engaging panel on Law & Psychology includes an overview of the field and presents six psychologists who conduct research and practice at the intersection of psychology and the law. Panelists use their background in psychology to educate attorneys, judges, and juries on the role of psychology to reduce bias, increase cooperation, ensure procedural fairness, and understand psychological evidence including eyewitness testimony. Clinical forensic psychologists conduct evaluations of harm, risk, and abilities such as competency to stand trial or criminal responsibility in family, civil, sentencing, and criminal cases; they may work with survivors of violence as well as offenders to ensure public safety, reduce recidivism, and prevent offenses. Panelists provide guidance about graduate education and deciding on a career in psychology and law."

    "text": "Do you know a promising student from an underrepresented group who is interest in psychology and law, but not currently involved in research? Recruit them into AP-LS’s AP program.\nApply Here\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Description\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        The purpose of the Access Path to Psychology and Law Experience (AP) Program is to increase diversity within psychology and law by increasing the pipeline of competitive graduate school applicants from groups that currently are underrepresented in the field, including racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, LGBT individuals, and disabled students. AP is designed to encourage faculty members to recruit students from underrepresented groups into their research labs. It provides financial support for the students to obtain meaningful research experience and attend the AP-LS conference as well as other opportunities for mentoring and development. It is the intention of the BRIDGE Committee that many of the students in the AP program will apply for graduate training related to psychology and law and ultimately become professionals in the field. The AP program primarily targets undergraduate students, but students from terminal master’s degree programs will also be considered. \n         Program requirements\n           Students in the AP program are required to:\n      \n work on research for approximately 10 hours per week for the duration of their research experience;\n participate in GRE classes and/or other development opportunities;\n attend an AP-LS conference;\n submit a proposal to present their research at an AP-LS conference or in the Div. 41 program of an APA conference;\n submit a summary of their research experience to the BRIDGE chair within one month of its completion;\n correspond with a secondary mentor from the BRIDGE Committee;\n participate in the ongoing assessment of the AP program.\n\n Faculty mentors in the AP program are required to:\n\n closely supervise their students to ensure that they have a meaningful research experience that will make them more competitive for graduate school;\n help identify and facilitate opportunities for their students to participate in GRE classes and/or other development programs offered on their campuses (e.g., through the McNair program);\n assist their students in making a conference presentation about their research;\n participate in the ongoing assessment of the AP program.\n\n\n\nAward amounts \nThe AP program will award up to $3,000 per student, depending on the length of the research experience. Recipients will be given a stipend of $1,200 per semester or $800 per quarter or summer for up to one year.

    "text": "To recognize the substantive contributions of clinical mentors who educate and support emerging clinicians in psychology and the law with a lens toward the elimination of REC disparities, and social justice.\nApply Here\n\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Description\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        REC disparities in the criminal justice system (CJS) necessitate that practicing psychologists working in the field of psychology and the law use their knowledge and experience to combat them. Practitioners are in a unique position to offer education, assessment, intervention and advocacy on issues of REC disparities, racism, and discrimination in the field of psychology and the law. However, a limited body of research, lack of practice guidelines on REC integration in forensic practice, and low representation of Black, Indigenous, People Of Color (BIPOC) professionals, limit such efforts. Mentorship of emerging practitioners in psychology and the law on such issues can bridge the gap of knowledge, application, and BIPOC representation in the field. \n         The AP-LS Practice Committee wants to recognize the substantive contributions of practitioner mentors who educate and support emerging clinicians in psychology and the law with a lens toward the elimination of REC disparities and social justice. For these purposes, we use Goldstein’s (2007) definition of the practice of psychology and the law: “The application of psychological research, theory, practice, and traditional and specialized methodology (e.g. interviewing, psychological testing, forensic assessment, and forensically relevant instruments) to provide information relevant to a legal question.”\n         The award for Outstanding Practitioner Mentoring to Eliminate Racial, Ethnic and Cultural (REC) Disparities in the Field of Psychology and the Law, will be conferred on a yearly basis. The recipient will receive a $500 cash award, a plaque to be presented at the annual AP-LS conference, and will be featured in an AP-LS newsletter article, written by the practice committee, highlighting the recipient’s achievements and recommendations to other practitioners. Highlighting the recipient's mentorship practices and experiences can serve as a model for other professionals in the field of psychology and the law.\n        \nReferences\n Goldstein, A.M. (2007).

To be eligible for the award, individuals must have a doctoral degree (PhD, PsyD, EdD), self-identify as a predominantly practicing forensic psychologist (about 75% of their work) and have a track record of excellence conducting mentorship of emerging forensic practitioners. Namely, the mentorship of graduate students, postdoctoral trainees, or early career professionals preparing for a career in direct service provision.\n\n\n             The mentorship can be formal (e.g. an assigned clinical supervisor or mentor in a training program or place of work). It can also be so-called “informal mentorship” where the mentor has dedicated their personal time to assist and support emerging clinicians outside formal institutional affiliations (e.g. an African American forensic psychologist who regularly mentors other BIPOC early career psychologists in their area). Excellence in mentorship can take many shapes and forms. A common thread would be mentoring emerging clinicians, regardless of race or ethnicity, on using their specialized skills and knowledge as forensic psychologists to reduce REC disparities. The practitioner’s mentorship has had a significant impact in the system in which they operate (e.g. supporting increased training opportunities on BIPOC issues, helping increase BIPOC representation in the field of psychology and the law, supporting antiracist professional identities for emerging forensic psychologists).\n\n\n\n \n    \n  \n  \n    \n\n  \n    \n      \n        How to Apply\n      \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      The nomination package should be converted into a PDF file and emailed directly to the chair of the award committee.

    "title": "Saleem Shah Early Career Award",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Recognizes early career excellence and contributions to the field of psychology and law with a focus on forensic practice, research, or public policy.\nCo-sponsored by American Academy of Forensic Psychology.\n\n\n    \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Background\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Saleem A. Shah, who was internationally known for his leadership in the field of law and mental health, died on Nov. 25, 1992, from injuries suffered when his automobile was struck by a drunken driver. Saleem was born on December 2, 1931, in Allahabad, India. After receiving a BA from Allahabad University, he came to the United States on a fellowship and earned his PhD in clinical psychology at Pennsylvania State University in 1957. He served as a graduate psychology intern at Spring Grove State Hospital, outside Baltimore, where he met his wife, Terry, with whom he had six daughters, all of whom survive him. After leaving Penn State, Saleem joined the Legal Psychiatric Services Division of the Department of Public Health in Washington, DC. He rose quickly to the post of chief psychologist and held this position until he joined the staff of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in 1966.\n\nSaleem remained at NIMH for the rest of his professional life. From 1968 to 1987, he was the chief of an extramural research program originally known as the Center for Studies of Crime and Delinquency and later as the Antisocial and Violent Behavior Branch. The scope of this program was extremely broad, covering such issues as the biology of antisocial behavior, delinquency, violence, and law and mental health studies. Saleem's mastery of this entire interdisciplinary program soon made him a legend inside and outside NIMH, but his greatest interest was always the field of law and mental health, which he saw as encompassing the full range of interactions between the legal and mental health systems (see Law and Mental Health: Major Developments and Research Needs, 1991, with Bruce Sales).\n\nSaleem's personal contributions to his field can perhaps be summed up as follows. He was committed, first and foremost, to the goal of achieving fair and equitable treatment for mentally disordered offenders and other persons whose mental status was at issue before the law. In his numerous scientific publications, he repeatedly drew attention to the tension between the therapeutic and the social control objectives of mental health laws and to the need for careful analysis of underlying constructs to establish a clear ethical and legal basis for policies and programs. As his writings on these topics became widely known, he was increasingly asked to give lectures and consultations in other countries, such as Germany, the former Soviet Union, and China.\n\nWhat Saleem could not do on his own, he accomplished through others. In 1968 he established law and mental health studies as a formal program priority for NIMH and became the guide and mentor for a new generation of scholars who by their empirical and theoretical work, much of it supported by NIMH, transformed the field of law and mental health studies: Thomas Grisso, John Monahan, Loren Roth, Bruce Sales, Henry Steadman, Linda Teplin, and David Wexler, to name but a few. Saleem also initiated an NIMH monograph series for the purpose of making current knowledge and research findings in law and mental health more readily available to policymakers and other potential users. More than 20 volumes were published during Saleem's lifetime on topics such as clinical prediction of violent behavior, competency to stand trial, mental health services in local jails, and clinical treatment of violent persons.\n\nSaleem received many honors. He was the first recipient of the American Psychology-Law Society Award for Distinguished Contributions to Psychology and Law; he also received the Isaac Ray Award of the American Psychiatric Association for outstanding contributions in law and mental health and six U.S. government awards.\n\nSaleem’s Rules\nAt the 2012 AP-LS Conference there was a session titled \"Saleem’s Rules: Lessons in Mentoring, Knowing What’s Right, and Changing the World - Why AP-LS Created a Saleem Shah Award\" with speakers Thomas Grisso, Henry J. Steadman, Edward Mulvey and John Monahan. Dr. Grisso wrote an article (PDF, 28KB)[insert link to pdf here] about that panel's discussions for the summer 2012 AP-LS News newsletter.\n\n\n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        Description\n      \n    \n    \n      \n       \n    \n  \n  The Saleem Shah Award is an annual award co-sponsored by the American Academy of Forensic Psychology and the American Psychology-Law Society recognizing early career excellence and exceptional contributions to the field of psychology and law.

    "text": "Apply Here\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Description\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        The intent of this grant initiative is to advance a more interdisciplinary science that addresses understudied topics in psychology and law, as well as to broaden the discipline and amplify its practical impact. Proposed projects must investigate new or understudied topics in psychology and law, enhance the diversification of psychology and law research through novel theoretical or methodological approaches that are cross-disciplinary in nature, and/or promote the impact of research by considering novel populations or new problems or processes within the legal system. The proposed project is to include collaboration with practitioners or policymakers. Successful proposals are expected to involve projects with the potential to transform and impact the field by furthering novel lines of research inquiry and/or facilitating new cross-disciplinary collaborations. \nAward amounts\nProposals may be submitted to one of two funding categories: small/seed proposals ($1,000-$5,000 for a 12-month research period) and large proposals ($15,000-$50,000 over a 12- to 18-month research period).\n Funding should primarily support research activities and data collection efforts. Support for research assistants and necessary travel may be requested, but should not constitute the majority of the requested funds. No funds can be used to support the salary of the principal investigator (PI) or co-PI. Funds for successful proposals will be awarded to the PI’s academic institution (via the institution’s Office of Sponsored Research or Foundation). No institutional indirect cost recovery will be permitted, and proposals submitted for consideration by this program must not be submitted for consideration by other grant programs (including AP-LS programs). Proposals submitted but not funded in previous funding cycles may be resubmitted, but all proposals will be evaluated as new proposals. \nResearchers may submit a maximum of one proposal to the large grant mechanism and one proposal to the small grant mechanism. That is, researchers can be an author or co-author on a maximum of one proposal to each of the grant categories. Students may not be PIs on proposals, although they may be co-PIs. \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Eligibility\n      \n    \n    \n      \nApplicants may submit only one small and one large proposal per funding cycle. A student cannot be a sole PI on any submission but are allowed to be a co-PI on a submission. At least one of the co-PIs needs to be an AP-LS member.\n \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        How to Apply\n      \n    \n    \n      \n      \n        The pre-proposal process\n    Interested researchers should submit a 1,000-word prospectus to the committee by October 15 at 11:59 p.m. PST.  All materials are submitted through the Div. 41 (AP-LS) awards page. \n     The prospectus should include four sections: \n        \n       Describe the project in no more than 500 words.  \n        Describe how the project contributes to the research initiative in no more than 500 words (See review criteria outlined below).  \n         A reference list (Does not count toward the word limit).  \n          A 150-word abstract describing the proposed research;  \n           Suggestions for three proposal reviewers. Suggested reviewers should not include anyone who might have a significant conflict of interest in reviewing the proposal (defined under full proposal “significant collaborators”). Please include the full name and email address of each suggested reviewer.  \n\n Please include the PI/co-PI name, title and email address.\n Based on review of the pre-proposals, investigators will be notified by November 15 about whether they are invited to submit a full proposal application. Full proposal applications will be due by December 16 at 11:59 p.m. PST.\n\nPre-proposal review criteria\n Contribution to the research initiative: To what extent and in what ways does the proposal contribute to the AP-LS research initiative? The specific criteria used ask to what extent does the proposal:\n      \n          investigate new or understudied topics in psychology and law;  \n\n          promote the impact of research by considering novel populations;\n  \n\n          use approaches that are cross-disciplinary in nature;  \n         \n           enhance the diversification of psychology and law research through novel theoretical approaches;  \n\n         promote the impact of research by considering new problems or processes; \n         enhance the diversification of psychology and law research through novel methodological approaches; \n         further novel lines of research that have potential to be transformative and impactful to the field; and \n         facilitate new cross disciplinary collaborations to be transformative and impactful to the field.\n\n\n       The full proposal process\n    For investigators invited to submit full proposal applications, full proposal applications are due by December 16, 2019, at 11:59 p.m. PST. All materials are submitted through the AP-LS awards page. \n     Proposals should include: \n        \n       PI and co-PI contact information and affiliations, and requested award amount/category;  \n        a 500-word abstract that summarizes the proposed project and highlights the project’s contributions to this research initiative;  \n         a 3,500-word project summary (for small/seed grants) or a 6,000-word project summary (for large grants). The summary should include a rationale for the proposed project; situate the novelty of the project within the existing literature; detail the proposed methods, data analytical approach, and timeline for completing the project; and specify the project’s contributions to this research initiative (See full proposal review criteria below);  \n          a reference list (does not count toward the word limit);  \n           a two-page CV for each PI and co-PI contributing to the project, including a list of “significant collaborators” that includes dissertation and master’s thesis advisors, current and past students, co-authors within the last five years, editors who have edited a book in which you have a chapter published, and authors who have published in a book you have edited;  \n       a proposed budget that details anticipated expenditures and a budget justification that links the requested funds to the proposed activities; and    \n       a statement of significant financial interest that discloses whether the researchers have significant financial interest in the outcome of the research proposal.\n   \n\n\n All submitted proposals will be reviewed by the AP-LS Research Committee, and selected proposals will be recommended for funding to the AP-LS Executive Committee. External (ad hoc) peer-review of proposals will be solicited to facilitate the review process.

The American Psychology-Law Society is both a free-standing organization as well as a division (Division 41) of the American Psychological Association. Members of AP-LS need not be members of APA, although many members belong to both organizations (AP-LS and APA). Membership is open to interested professionals and students in other disciplines beyond psychology. Membership is for the calendar year January 1 - December 31.\nMembership in AP-LS entitles one to online access of the journal, Law and Human Behavior and the American Psychology-Law Monthly E-News. AP-LS also sponsors an annual meeting as well as programs at the APA convention. The activities of AP-LS/Division 41 in its brief history have been quite diverse, including developing a collection of course syllabi and teaching materials, conducting a survey of career opportunities in psychology and law, studying special ethical problems in expert testimony, drafting recommendations, and sponsoring an annual conference."
